{"1":"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all those set apart in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.","2":"May grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","3":"I thank my God every time I remember you;","4":"and always in every prayer for all of you, I pray with joy.","5":"I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now.","6":"I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.","7":"It is right for me to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel.","8":"For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.","9":"I am praying this: That your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all understanding.","10":"I pray for this so that you may approve what is excellent, and so you may be sincere and without offense on the day of Christ.","11":"I pray that you also will be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.","12":"Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.","13":"As a result, my chains in Christ came to light throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.","14":"Most of the brothers have far more confidence in the Lord because of my chains, and they have courage to fearlessly speak the word.","15":"Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and also others out of good will.","16":"The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.","17":"But the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely. They think they will afflict me while I am in chains.","18":"What then? Only that in every way—whether from false motives or from true—Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,","19":"for I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.","20":"It is my eager expectation and certain hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but that I will have complete boldness, so that now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.","21":"For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.","22":"But if I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which to choose? I do not know.","23":"For I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, which is far better,","24":"yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.","25":"Being convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,","26":"so that in me you may have increasing reasons to boast in Christ Jesus when I come to you again.","27":"Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come to see you or am absent, I may hear about you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.","28":"Do not be frightened in any respect by those who are your opponents. This is a sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation—and this from God.","29":"For it has been granted to you, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,","30":"having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now you hear in me."}
