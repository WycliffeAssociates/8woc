\v 17 Brothers, join me and imitate me, and watch closely those who are walking by our example. \v 18 I have often told you, and tell you now with tears, that many are living as enemies of the cross of Christ. \v 19 Their destiny is destruction because their god is their belly and their glory is in their shame. They are thinking about earthly things.
