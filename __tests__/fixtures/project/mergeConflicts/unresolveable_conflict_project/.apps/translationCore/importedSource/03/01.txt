\v 1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  For me to write these same things to you is not a problem, and they will keep you safe. \v 2 Watch out for the dogs. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out for the mutilators. \v 3 For we are the true circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God, glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
