\v 8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any excellence in them, and if there is any praise in them, think on these things. \v 9 Do the things that you have learned, received, heard, and have seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.
