\v 28 And do not be frightened by anything from those opposing you, which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, salvation that is from God. \v 29 Because to you it has been granted on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf, \v 30 since you have to suffer the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
