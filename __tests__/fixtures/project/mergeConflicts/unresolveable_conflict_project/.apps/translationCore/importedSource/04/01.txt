\v 1 Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends. \p \v 2 I am pleading with Euodia, and I am pleading with Syntyche, be of the same mind in the Lord. \v 3 Indeed, I am entreating you too, my true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in spreading the gospel along with Clement  and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
