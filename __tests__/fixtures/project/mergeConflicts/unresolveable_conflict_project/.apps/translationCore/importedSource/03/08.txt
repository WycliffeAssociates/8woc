\v 8 In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things; I consider them garbage so that I may gain Christ. \v 9 And now I am found in him; I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness from God that is through faith in Christ. \v 10 It is a righteousness of knowing him, the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferingsï¿½and I am transformed by Christ into the likeness of his death, \v 11 so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead.
