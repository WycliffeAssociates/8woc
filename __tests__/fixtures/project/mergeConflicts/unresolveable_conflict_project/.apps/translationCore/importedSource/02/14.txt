\v 14 Do everything without complaining and arguing, \v 15 so that you may become blameless and honest children of God without blemish, and shine as lights in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. \v 16 Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory in the day of Christ, because then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.
