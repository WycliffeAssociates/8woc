\v 12 I have not yet received these things, so I am not yet complete. But I continue pressing on, in order that I may grasp that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus. \v 13 Brothers, I do not think that I myself have taken possession of it.  But one thing I do is this: I forget what is behind and strive for what is ahead. \v 14 I continue pressing on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus.
