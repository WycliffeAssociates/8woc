\v 10 I rejoice in the Lord greatly because now at last you have renewed your concern for me. Although previously you were thinking of me, there was no opportunity for you to help. \v 11 I am not referring to my needs, for I have learned to be content in all circumstances. \v 12 I know how to live in times of need, and I also know how to live in times of abundance. In every way I have learned the secret how both to have plenty and to be hungry, how both to abound and to need. \v 13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
