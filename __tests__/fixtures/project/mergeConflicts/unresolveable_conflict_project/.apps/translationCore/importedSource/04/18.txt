\v 18 I have all things in abundance. I am filled. I have received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you. They are a sweet smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God. \v 19 And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. \v 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. \b
