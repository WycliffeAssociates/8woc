\v 5 Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, \q \v 6 who existed in the form of God. \q2 He did not consider his equality with God  \q3 as something to hold on to. \q \v 7 But instead he emptied himself. \q2 He took the form of a servant. \q2 He appeared in the likeness of men. \q  He was found in appearance as a man. \q2 \v 8 He humbled himself and obeyed to the point of death,  \q2   even the death of the cross.
