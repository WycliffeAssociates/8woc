\v 12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel. \v 13 This is because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else. \v 14 And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.
