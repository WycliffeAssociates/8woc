\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. \v 5 Your gentleness needs to be made known to all people. The Lord is near. \v 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but instead in everything by prayer in requests tell God what you need and thank him. \v 7 And the peace of God, which exceeds all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. \b
