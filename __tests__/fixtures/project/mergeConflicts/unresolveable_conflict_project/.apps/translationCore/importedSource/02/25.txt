\v 25 I think it necessary to send you back Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need. \v 26 Because you heard he was sick, he was deeply distressed and longed to be with you all. \v 27 For indeed he was so sick he almost died, but God had mercy on him. And not on him only, but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
