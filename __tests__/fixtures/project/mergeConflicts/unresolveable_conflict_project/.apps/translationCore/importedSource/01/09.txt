\v 9 And I am praying that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and complete understanding. \v 10 I do this so that you may test and choose the things that are excellent in order that you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ. \v 11 Also, that you will be filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
