\v 25 Since I am confident about this, I know that I will remain, yes, and that I will continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith. \v 26 As a result, you should be proud of me in Christ Jesus when I am present with you again. \v 27 Only conduct your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that, whether I come to see you or I am absent, I may hear about how you stand firmly in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel.
