\v 3 I thank my God with every thought of you, \v 4 Every time I pray for you, it is always a prayer of joy. \v 5 I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now. \v 6 I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
