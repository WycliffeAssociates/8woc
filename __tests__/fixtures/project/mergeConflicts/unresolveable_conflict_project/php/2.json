{"1":"If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions, ","2":"make my joy full so that you are of the same mind, have the same love, are united in spirit, and have the same purpose.","3":"Do nothing through selfishness or empty pride, but instead in lowliness of mind count others better than yourself. ","4":"Do not look out for each of your own needs, but also look out for the needs of others.","5":"Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, \\q ","6":"who existed in the form of God. \\q2 He did not consider his equality with God  \\q3 as something to hold on to. \\q ","7":"But instead he emptied himself. \\q2 He took the form of a servant. \\q2 He appeared in the likeness of men. \\q  He was found in appearance as a man. \\q2 ","8":"He humbled himself and obeyed to the point of death,  \\q2   even the death of the cross.","9":"Therefore also God highly exalted him,  \\q2 and gave him the name above every name. \\q ","10":"So at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,  \\q2 of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth. \\q ","11":"And every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,  \\q2 to the glory of God the Father.","12":"So then, my beloved, even as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. ","13":"For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.","14":"Do everything without complaining and arguing, ","15":"so that you may become blameless and honest children of God without blemish, and shine as lights in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. ","16":"Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory in the day of Christ, because then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.","17":"But even if my life is poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with great joy with you all. ","18":"And in the same manner you also must rejoice with great joy with me.","19":"But I expect in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that his report may also encourage me when I know how you are doing. ","20":"I have no one like Timothy who will truly care for you. ","21":"For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ.","22":"But you know Timothy has proven himself, because, as a child serves his father, so he served with me in the spread of the gospel. ","23":"Therefore I expect to send him as soon as I see how things will go with me. ","24":"But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon, also.","25":"I think it necessary to send you back Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need. ","26":"Because you heard he was sick, he was deeply distressed and longed to be with you all. ","27":"For indeed he was so sick he almost died, but God had mercy on him. And not on him only, but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.","28":"Therefore I am eager to send him so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I will not worry so much. ","29":"Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy and honor him as people like him deserve, ","30":"because he almost died doing the work of Christ, as he risked his life to serve me and supply my needs, in place of you who could not do it."}
