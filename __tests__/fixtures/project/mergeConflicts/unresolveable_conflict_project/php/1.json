","5":"I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now. ","6":"I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.","7":"It is right for me to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and guaranteeing of the gospel. ","8":"For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the depths of the love of Christ Jesus. >>>>>>> 577d8401333b1e5a800cd1975bb22a544db87a5c","9":"And I am praying that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and complete understanding.

","11":"Also, that you will be filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.","12":"Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel. ","13":"This is because my bonds in Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else. ","14":"And also so that most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.","15":"Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and others also out of good will. ","16":"The ones who proclaim Christ out of love know that I have been assigned to defend the gospel. ","17":"But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish and insincere motives. They think they are adding to the affliction I suffer in my imprisonment.","18":"So what? Either way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and I rejoice in that, yes indeed, I will rejoice. ","19":"For I know that this will lead to my deliverance, because of your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.","20":"It is my confident expectation and certainty that I will not be ashamed. But with all courage, as always and especially right now, I will bring glory to Christ in my body, whether by life or by death.

","23":"For I am pulled by both of these choices. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is much, much better! ","24":"Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.","25":"Since I am confident about this, I know that I will remain, yes, and that I will continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith. ","26":"As a result, you should be proud of me in Christ Jesus when I am present with you again. ","27":"Only conduct your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that, whether I come to see you or I am absent, I may hear about how you stand firmly in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel.","28":"And do not be frightened by anything from those opposing you, which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, salvation that is from God. ","29":"Because to you it has been granted on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf, ","30":"since you have to suffer the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me."}
