  TODO:
  This selector is going to give is problems when we have a setting to switch between
  drag to select and click to select. It will need to be moved to a JSX style that we
  can changed based on an api property.

  BUT we cant use psuedo classes within the JSX styling syntax. If anyone finds a way
  to do this that would be great but my research shows that is not possible so we may
  have to go another route.
