/**
Object that maps words to consts for use in actions
For example, in a register callback in a Store, it is recommended
that when you check the action type, you do it in the following manner:
<<<<<<< HEAD
var consts = require("CoreActionConsts.js");
...
if (action == consts.ADD_CHECK)
rather than
if (action == "ADD_CHECK")
This keeps it modular and stuff probably
=======

var consts = require("CoreActionConsts.js");
...
if (action == consts.ADD_CHECK)

rather than

if (action == "ADD_CHECK")

This keeps it modular and stuff probably

>>>>>>> develop
Just add in more actions as they are needed
