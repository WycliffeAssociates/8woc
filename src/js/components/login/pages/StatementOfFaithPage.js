            We believe that Christian belief can and should be divided into&nbsp;
            <b>essential beliefs</b> and <b>peripheral beliefs.</b>
          </p>
          <h4><b>Essential beliefs</b></h4>
          <p>
            Essential beliefs are what define a follower of Jesus Christ and can never be compromised or ignored.
          </p>
          <ul style={{marginLeft: "30px", padding: "10px"}}>
            <li>
              We believe the Bible to be the only inspired, inerrant, sufficient, authoritative Word of God.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, Jesus&nbsp;
              Christ the Son and the Holy Spirit.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the humanity of Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life,&nbsp;
              in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily&nbsp;
              resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that every person is inherently sinful and so is deserving of eternal hell.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that salvation from sin is a gift of God, provided through the sacrificial death and&nbsp;
              resurrection of Jesus Christ, attained by grace through faith, not by works.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe that true faith is always accompanied by repentance and regeneration by the Holy Spirit.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the follower of Jesus&nbsp;
              Christ is enabled to live a godly life.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the spiritual unity of all believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, from all nations and&nbsp;
              languages and people groups.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the personal and physical return of Jesus Christ.
            </li>
            <li>
              We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; the unsaved will be resurrected to&nbsp;
              eternal damnation in hell and the saved will be resurrected to eternal blessing in heaven with God.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4><b>Peripheral beliefs</b></h4>
          <p>
            Peripheral beliefs are everything else that is in Scripture but about which sincere followers&nbsp;
            of Christ may disagree (e.g. Baptism, Lordâ€™s Supper, the Rapture, etc.). We choose to agree to&nbsp;
            disagree agreeably on these topics and press on together toward a common goal of making disciples&nbsp;
            of every people group (Matthew 28:18-20).
