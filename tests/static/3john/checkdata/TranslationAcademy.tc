This module will discuss the skills that will be needed by members of the Bible translation team, and the responsibilities that these people will have. Some people will have many skills and responsibilities, and other people will have only a few. But it is important that every Bible translation team include enough people to make sure that all of these skills are represented on the team.\n\n#### Church Leaders\n\nBefore starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. \n\n#### Translation Committee\n\nIt is good if the leaders of these churches and church networks can form a committee to guide the work, choose the translators, resolve problems that arise, and encourage the churches to pray for the work and to support the work financially. \n\nThis committee can also choose the people who will check the translation for accuracy at levels 2 and 3.\n\nWhen it comes time, this committee can also make decisions about the format of the translation, how it will be distributed, and they can encourage the churches to use the translated Scriptures.\n\n#### Translators\n\nThese are the people who will do the work of making the translation drafts. They will be appointed by the Translation Committee. They need to be people who are native speakers of the target language, who can read the source language (the Gateway Language) very well, and who are respected in the community for their Christian character. For more details about these things, see [Translator Qualifications](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/qualifications.md). \n\nAs well as making the first drafts, these people will form the core of the translation team that will check each other's work, check the translation with the language community, and receive the suggestions for revision from the level 2 and level 3 checkers. After each review or checking session, these translators are responsible to make the changes to the translation that are necessary so that it communicates what it should in the best way. So they will revise the translation many, many times.\n\n#### Typists\n\nIf the translators themselves are not inputting the translation draft into a computer or tablet, then someone else on the team needs to do this. This needs to be someone who can type without making a lot of errors. This person also needs to know how to use punctuation marks correctly and consistently. This person may also need to type the revisions and corrections to the translation after each round of checking.\n\n#### Translation Testers\n\nSome people need to test the translation with members of the language community to make sure that the translation is clear and sounds natural in the target language. Usually these are the translators, but they could be other people. These testers need to read the translation to people and then ask them questions to see how they are understanding it. For a description of this task, see [Other Methods](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-checking-vol1/src/master/content/other_methods.md). \n\n#### Checkers\n\nThe people who are selected to check the translation for accuracy should be people who already know the Bible well in the source language. They should be able to read well in the source language. They will be comparing the translation to the source Bible, to make sure that the translation communicates everything that is in the source Bible. They should be people who are interested in the translation work and who have time to do a good job of checking. It is good if these people can include members of the different church groups who speak the target language and who will use the translation. The level 2 checkers should be leaders in their local church. The level 3 checkers should be leaders of groups of churches, or respected very widely in the language area. Since many of these people are very busy, it may work best to send different books or chapters to different people, and not burden one or two people with the whole translation.\n\n",

Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about. This can be confusing to the reader.\n\n**Reason this is a translation issue:** Readers might think that the events happened in the order that they are told. It is important to help them understand the correct order of events.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n> But then Herod ... had John locked up in prison. Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized. (Luke 3:20-21 ULB)\n\nThis could sound like John baptized Jesus after John was locked up in prison.\n> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets… But Joshua commanded the people, saying, \"Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout.\"   (Joshua 6:8-10 ULB) \n\nThis sounds like Joshua gave the order not to shout after the army had already started their march.\n>Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals? (Revelation 5:2 ULB)\n\nThe seals that lock the scroll must be broken before the scroll can be unrolled.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. If your language uses phrases or time words to show that an event happened before one that was already mentioned, consider using one of them.\n  1. If your language uses verb tense or aspect to show that an event happened before one that was already mentioned, consider using that. (See: the section on Aspect on [Verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_verbs.md))\n  1. If your language prefers to tell events in the order that they occurred, consider reordering the events so they they are in that order. This may require putting two or more verses together (like 5-6).

There are two types information.\n\n  * **Explicit information** is what the speaker states directly.\n  * **Implicit information** is what the speaker does not state directly because he expects his audience to be able to learn it from what he says.\n\n### Description\n\nWhen someone speaks or writes, he has something specific that he wants people to know. He normally states this directly. This is **explicit information**.\n\nThe speaker assumes that his audience already knows certain things that they will think about in order to understand this information. Normally he does not tell people these things, although what he says may remind them. This is called **assumed knowledge**. \n\nThe speaker does not always directly state everything that he expects his audience to learn from what he says. Information that he expects people to learn from what he says even though he does not state it directly is **implicit information.**\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Then a scribe came to him and said, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" Jesus said to him, \"Foxes <u>have holes</u>, and the birds of the sky <u>have nests</u>, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\"  (Matthew 8:20 ULB)\n\nJesus did not say what foxes and birds use holes and nests for, because he assumed that the scribe would have known that foxes sleep in holes in the ground and birds sleep in their nests. This is **assumed knowledge**. Jesus did not directly say here \"I am the Son of Man\" but, if the scribe did not already know it, then that fact would be **implicit information** that he could learn because Jesus referred to himself that way. Jesus did not state explicitly that  he travelled a lot and did not have a house that he slept in every night. That is **implicit information** that the scribe could learn when Jesus said that he had nowhere to lay his head.\n\n> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.  (Matthew 11:21, 22 ULB)\n\nJesus assumed that the people he was speaking to knew that Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and that the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. Jesus also knew that the people he was talking to believed that they were good and did not need to repent.  Jesus did not need to tell them these things. This is all **assumed knowledge**.\n\nAn important piece of **implicit information** here is that because the people he was speaking to did not repent, they would be judged more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon would be judged. \n>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For <u>they do not wash their hands when they eat</u>. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)\n\nOne of the traditions of the elders was a ceremony in which people would wash their hands in order to be ritually clean before eating. People thought that in order to be righteous, they had to follow all the traditions of the elders. This was **assumed knowledge** that the Pharisees who were speaking to Jesus expected him to know. They were accusing his disciples of not following the traditions. This is **implicit information** that they wanted him to understand from what they said.\n\n",

This can make it hard for them to understand what a speaker or writer says, and to learn things that the speaker left implicit. Translators may need to state some things clearly in the translation that the original speaker or writer left unstated or implicit.\n\n### Description\n\nWhen someone speaks or writes, he expects his audience to know certain things that they can think about to help them understand what he means by his words. The things he actually says are **explicit information**. The things that he expects them to already know or be able to learn are **implicit information**. Normally a speaker or writer does not tell people things that he believes they already know. And sometimes he does not state clearly things that expects them to be able to understand from what he says.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * Readers may not understand the message if they do not know things that the original speakers and hearers knew.\n  * Modern readers do not know everything that the original speakers and hearers in the Bible knew.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Woe to you, Chorazin!

(Matthew 11:22 ULB)\n\nThe people that Jesus was talking to knew that the people of Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and that the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. They also believed that they themselves were righteous and did not need to repent. Today's readers need to know these things in order to understand that Jesus was telling the people that they would be punished more severely because they did to repent, even though they saw the mighty deeds that Jesus did.\n>Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)\n\nModern readers could think the Pharisees were saying that the disciples should wash their hands before eating in order to keep from getting sick from germs on the hands. But for the Jews, washing the hands before eating was a ceremony that they practiced in order to be ritually clean. The elders had given them this tradition, and they believed that people had to follow all the traditions of the elders in order to be righteous. This is assumed knowledge. The Pharisees were accusing Jesus disciples of not being righteous. This is implicit knowledge.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf readers have enough assumed knowledge to be able to understand the message and any important implicit information that goes with it, then consider leaving that knowledge unstated and leave the implicit information implicit. \n\n  1. If readers cannot understand the message because they do not have certain assumed knowledge, then provide that knowledge as explicit information. \n  1. If readers cannot understand important implicit information, then state that information explicitly.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If readers cannot understand the message because they do not know certain implicit information, then state that information clearly.\n\n  * **it will be more tolerable for <u>Tyre and Sidon</u>  at the day of judgment than for you**  (Matthew 11:22 ULB) - Assumed knowledge is that the people of Tyre and Sidon were very very wicked. This can be stated explicitly.\n      * \"it will be more tolerable for <u>Tyre and Sidon, cities whose people were very wicked</u> at the day of judgment than for you\"\n\n  * **Jesus said to him, \"Foxes <u>have holes</u>, and the birds of the sky <u>have nests</u>, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\"**  (Matthew 8:20 ULB) - Assumed knowledge was that the foxes slept in their holes and birds slept in their nests.\n      * \"Jesus said to him, \"Foxes <u>have holes to live in</u>, and the birds of the sky <u>have nests to live in</u>, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head and sleep.\"\"\n\n  * **Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For <u>they do not wash their hands</u>  when they eat.**  (Matthew 15:2 ULB)\n      * \"Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For <u>they do not go through the ceremonial handwashing ritual</u>  when they eat.\"\n\n2. If readers cannot understand important implicit information, then state that information explicitly.\n\n  * **it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon  at the day of judgment than for you**  (Matthew 11:22 ULB) - God's would not only judge the people; he would punish them. This is implicit information. It can be made explicit.\n      * \"God will <u>punish Tyre and Sidon</u>, cities whose people were very wicked, <u>less severely than he will punish you</u>\"\n      * \"God will <u>punish you more severely</u> than Tyre and Sidon, cities whose people were very wicked.\"\n\n  * **Then a scribe came to him and said, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\"** (Matthew 8:19, 20 ULB) - Jesus referred to himself as the Son of Man.

The implicit information is that the disciples should beware of the false teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. But Jesus' disciples did not understand this. They thought that Jesus was talking about real yeast and bread. So it would not be appropriate to state explicitly that  the word \"yeast\" here refers to false teaching. The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant until they heard what Jesus said in Matthew 16:11\n> \"How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" Then they understood that he was not telling them to beware of yeast in bread, but to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. (Matthew 16:11,12 ULB)\n\nAfter Jesus explained that he was not talking about bread, they realized that he was talking about the false teaching of the Pharisees. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nThis page does not have any translation strategies.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\nThis page does not have any translation strategies applied.\n\n",

We also use them to express regret or wishes. These occur often in the Bible. We need to translate them in a way that people will know that the event did not actually happen, and that they will understand why the event was imagined.\n\n### Description\n\nHypothetical situations are situations that are not real. They can be in the past, present, or future. Hypothetical situations in the past and present have not happened, and ones in the future are not expected to happen.\n\nPeople sometimes tell about conditions and what would happen if those conditions were met, but they know that these things have not happened or probably will not happen. (The conditions are the phrase that start with \"if.\")\n\n  * If he had known about the party, he would have come to it. (But he did not come.)\n  * If he knew about the party, he would be here. (But he is not here.)\n  * If he knew about the party, he would come to it. (But he probably will not come.)\n\nPeople sometimes express wishes about things that have not happened or that are not expected to happen.\n\n  * I wish he had come. \n  * I wish he were here.\n  * I wish he would come.\n\nPeople sometimes express regrets about things that have not happened or that are not expected to happen.\n\n  * If only he had come.\n  * If only he were here.\n  * If only he would come.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\n  * Translators need recognize the different kinds of hypothetical situations in the Bible.\n  * Translators need to know their own language's ways of talking about different kinds of hypothetical situations.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n1.Hypothetical situation in the past\n\n> \"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\" (Matthew 11:21 ULB)\n\n\nHere in Matthew 11:21 Jesus said that if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he performed, they would have repented long ago. He said this to rebuke the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida who had seen his miracles yet did not repent. The people of Tyre and Sidon did not actually see his miracles and repent. \n\n2.Hypothetical situations in the present\n\n> Also, no man puts new wine into old wineskins. If he did that, the new wine would burst the skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed. (Luke 5:37 ULB)\n\n\nJesus told about what would happen if a person were to put new wine into old wineskins. But no one would do that. He used this imaginary situation as an example to show that people do not mix new things with old things. He did this so that people could understand why his disciples were not fasting as people traditionally did.\n>Jesus said to them, \"What man would there be among you, who, <u>if</u>  he had just one sheep, and if this sheep fell into a deep hole on the Sabbath, would not grasp hold of it and lift it out? (Matthew 12:11 ULB)\n\n\nJesus asked the religious leaders what they would do on the Sabbath if one of their sheep fell into a hole. He was not saying that their sheep would fall into a hole. He used this imaginary situation to show them that they were wrong to judge him for healing people on the Sabbath. \n\n3.Hypothetical situation in the future\n\n> <u>Unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved</u>; but for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened. (Matthew 24:22 ULB)\n\n\nJesus was talking about a future time when very bad things would happen. He told what would happen if those days of trouble were to last a long time. He did this to show about bad those days will be - so bad that if they lasted a long time, no one would be saved. But then he clarified that God will shorten those days of trouble, so that the elect (those he has chosen) will be saved.  \n\n4.Expressing emotion about a hypothetical situation\n \nRegrets and wishes are very similar.\n>The Israelites said to them, \"<u>If only we had died by Yahweh's hand in the land of Egypt when we were sitting by the pots of meat and were eating bread to the full.</u> For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill our whole community with hunger.\" (Exodus 16:3 ULB)\n\n\nHere the Israelites were afraid they would have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they wished that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs. They were complaining.\n> I know what you have done, and that you are neither cold nor hot. <u>I wish that you were either cold or hot!</u> (Revelation 3:15 ULB)\n\n\nJesus' wished that the people were either hot or cold. He was rebuking them.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nKnow how people speaking your language show:\n\n  * that something could have happened, but did not.\n  * that something could be true now, but is not.\n  * that something could happen in the future, but will not unless something changes.\n  * that they wish for something, but it does not happen.\n  * that they regret that something did not happen.\n\nUse your language's ways of showing these kinds of things. \n\nYou may also want to watch the video at http://ufw.io/figs_hypo.\n\n",

(Luke 7:6 ULB) \n\nThe phrase \"enter under my roof\" is an idiom that means \"enter my house.\"\n\n> Let these words go deeply into your ears  (Luke 9:44 ULB)\n\nThis idiom means \"Listen carefully and remember what I say.\"\n\n**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and people understand it clearly, other people start to use it. After a while, it becomes a normal way of talking in that language. \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * People can easily misunderstand idioms in the original languages of the Bible if they do not know the cultures that produced the Bible.\n  * People can easily misunderstand idioms that are in the source language Bibles if they do not know the cultures that made those translations.\n  * It is useless to translate idioms literally (according to the meaning of each word) when the target language audience will not understand what they mean.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>\"Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, \"Look, we are your flesh and bone.\" (1 Chronicles 11:1 ULB)\n\nThis means, \"We and you belong to the same race, the same family.\"\n\n> the children of Israel went out with a high hand. (Exodus 14:8 ASV)\n\nThis means, \"The Israelites went out defiantly.\" \n\n>the one who lifts up my head (Psalm 3:3 ULB)\n\nThis means, \"the one who helps me.\" \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the idiom would be clearly understood in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other options.\n\n1. Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.\n1. Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1.

There are different kinds of figures of speech. This page lists and defines some of those that are used in the Bible.\n\n### Definition\n\nFigures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of a figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of its words. In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize figures of speech and know what the figure of speech means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language. \n\n### Types\n\nListed below are different types of Figures of Speech. If you would like additional information simply click the colored word to be directed to a page containing definitions, examples, and videos for each figure of speech.\n\n  * **[Apostrophe](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_apostrophe.md)** - An apostrophe is a figure of speech in which a speaker directly addresses someone who is not there, or addresses a thing that is not a person.\n\n  * **[Doublet](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_doublet.md)** - A doublet is a pair of words or very short phrases that mean the same thing and that are used in the same phrase. In the Bible, doublets are often used in poetry, prophecy, and sermons to emphasize an idea.\n\n  * **[Euphemism](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_euphemism.md)** - A euphemism is a mild or polite way of referring to something that is unpleasant or embarrassing. Its purpose is to avoid offending the people who hear or read it.\n\n  * **[Hendiadys](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_hendiadys.md)** - In hendiadys a single idea is expressed with two words connected with \"and,\" when one word could be used to modify the other.\n\n  * **[Hyperbole](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_hyperbole.md)** - A hyperbole is a deliberate exaggeration used to indicate the speaker's feeling or opinion about something.\n\n  * **[Idiom](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_idiom.md)** - An idiom is a group of words that has a meaning that is different from what one would understand from the meanings of the individual words.\n\n  * **[Irony](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_irony.md)** - Irony is a figure of speech in which the sense that the speaker intends to communicate is actually the opposite of the literal meaning of the words. \n\n  * **[Litotes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_litotes.md)** - Litotes is an emphatic statement about something made by negating an opposite expression.\n\n  * **[Merism](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_merism.md)** - Merism is a figure of speech in which a person refers to something by listing some of its parts or by speaking of two extreme parts of it.\n\n  * **[Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md)** - A metaphor is a figure in which one concept is used in place of another, unrelated concept. This invites the hearer to think of what the unrelated concepts have in common. That is, metaphor is an implied comparison between two unrelated things. \n\n  * **[Metonymy](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_metonymy.md)** - Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.\n\n  * **[Parallelism](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_parallelism.md)** - In parallelism two phrases or clauses that are similar in structure or idea are used together. It is found throughout the whole of the Hebrew Bible, most commonly in the poetry of the books of Psalms and Proverbs.\n\n  * **[Personification](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_personification.md)** - Personification is a figure in which an idea or something that is not human is referred to as if it were a person and could do the things that people do or have the qualities that people have.\n\n  * **[Predictive Past](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_pastforfuture.md)** - The predictive past is a form that some languages use to refer to things that will happen in the future. This is sometimes done in prophecy to show that the event will certainly happen.\n\n  * **[Rhetorical Question](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_rquestion.md)** - A rhetorical question is a question that is used for something other than getting information. Often it indicates the speaker's attitude toward the topic or the listener. Often it is used for rebuking or scolding, but some languages have other purposes as well.\n\n  * **[Simile](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_simile.md)** - A simile is a comparison of two things that are not normally thought to be similar. It focuses on a particular trait that the two items have in common, and it includes words such as \"like,\" \"as,\" or \"than\" to make the comparison explicit.\n\n  * **[Synecdoche](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_synecdoche.md)** - Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which 1) the name of a part of something is used to refer to the whole thing, or 2) the name of a whole thing is used to refer to just one part of it.\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes a person does this by using someone else's words, but in a way that communicates that he does not agree with them. People do this to emphasize how different something is from what it should be, or how someone else's belief about something is wrong or foolish. It is often humorous.\n\n>Jesus answered them, \"People who are in good health do not need a physician, only people who are sick need one. I did not come to call righteous people to repentance, but to call sinners to repentance.\" (Luke 5:31-32 ULB)\n\nWhen Jesus spoke of \"righteous people,\" he was not referring to people who were truly righteous, but to people who wrongly believed that they were righteous. By using irony, Jesus communicated that they were wrong to think that they were better than others and did not need to repent.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\n  * If someone does not realize that a speaker is using irony, he will think that the speaker actually believes what he is saying. He will understand the passage to mean the opposite of what it ws intended to mean.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n><u>How well you reject the commandment of God</u> so you may keep your tradition! (Mark 7:9 ULB)\n\n Here Jesus praises the Pharisees for doing something that is obviously wrong. Through irony, he communicates the opposite of praise: He communicates that the Pharisees, who take great pride in keeping the commandments, are so far from God that they do not even recognize that their traditions are breaking God's commandments. The use of irony makes the Pharisee's sin more obvious and startling. \n\n>\"Present your case,\" says Yahweh; \"present your best arguments for your idols,\" says the King of Jacob. <u>\"Let them bring us their own arguments; have them come forward and declare to us what will happen, so we may know these things well. Have them tell us of earlier predictive declarations, so we can reflect on them and know how they were fulfilled</u>.\"  (Isaiah 41:21-22 ULB)\n\nPeople worshiped idols as if their idols had knowledge or power, and Yahweh was angry at them for doing that. So he used irony and challenged their idols to tell what would happen in the future. He knew that the idols could not do this, but by speaking as if they could, he mocked the idols, making their inability more obvious, and rebuked the people for worshiping them.\n\n>Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work?  \n>Can you find the way back to their houses for them?  \n><u>Undoubtedly you know, for you were born then;</u>  \n>\"<u>the number of your days is so large!</u>\" (Job 38:20, 21 ULB)  \n\nJob thought that he was wise. Yahweh used irony to show Job that he was not so wise. The two underlined phrases above are irony. They emphasize the opposite of what they say, because they are so obviously false. They emphasize that Job could not possibly answer God's questions about the creation of light because Job was not born until many, many years later.\n\n>Already you have all you could want! Already you have become rich! You began to reign—and that quite apart from us! (1 Corinthians 4:8 ULB)\n\nThe Corinthians considered themselves to be very wise, self-sufficient, and not in need of any instruction from the Apostle Paul. Paul used irony, speaking as if he agreed with them, to show how proudly they were acting and how far from being wise they really were.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the irony would be understood correctly in your language, translate it as it is stated. If not, here are some other strategies.\n\n  1. Translate it in a way that shows that the speaker is saying what someone else believes.  \n  1. Translate the actual, intended meaning of the statement of irony. The actual meaning of the irony is <u>not</u> found in the literal words of the speaker, but instead the true meaning is found in the opposite of the literal meaning of the speaker's words.     \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1) Translate it in a way that shows that the speaker is saying what someone else believes.  \n\n* **<u>How well you reject the commandment of God</u> so you may keep your tradition!** (Mark 7:9 ULB)\n    * <u>You think that you are doing well when you reject God's commandment</u> so you may keep your tradition! \n    * <u>You act like it is good to reject God's commandment</u> so you may keep your tradition!\n\n* **I did not come to call <u>righteous people</u> to repentance, but to call sinners to repentance.** (Luke 5:32 ULB)\n    * \"I did not come to call <u>people who think that they are righteous</u> to repentance, but to call sinners to repentance.\"\n\n2) Translate the actual, intended meaning of the statement of irony.\n\n* **<u>How well you reject the commandment of God</u> so you may keep your tradition!** (Mark 7:9 ULB)\n    * <u>You are doing a terrible thing when you reject the commandment of God</u> so you may keep your tradition!\n\n* **\"Present your case,\" says Yahweh; \"present your best arguments for your idols,\" says the King of Jacob. \"Let them bring us their own arguments; have them come forward and declare to us what will happen, so we may know these things well. Have them tell us of earlier predictive declarations, so we can reflect on them and know how they were fulfilled.\"**  (Isaiah 41:21-22 ULB)\n      * \" 'Present your case,' says Yahweh; 'present your best arguments for your idols,' says the King of Jacob. Your idols <u>cannot bring us their own arguments or even come forward to  declare to us what will happen</u>. We cannot hear them because <u>they cannot speak</u> to tell us their earlier predictive declarations, so we cannot reflect on them and know how they were fulfilled.\"\n\n\n  * **Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work?**  \n**Can you find the way back to their houses for them?**  \n**<u>Undoubtedly you know, for you were born then;</u>**  \n**<u>the number of your days is so large!</u>\"** (Job 38:20, 21 ULB) \n\n* \"Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work?

      "file": "---\ntitle: Metaphor\nquestion: What is a metaphor and how can I translate a sentence that has one?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 1\nslug: figs_metaphor\ndependencies:  [\"figs_intro\", \"figs_simile\"]\nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: \noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/translate/metaphor\ncredits: \n---\n### Description\n\nA metaphor is a figure of speech in which one concept is used for another, in which there is one point of comparison between the two. In other words, in metaphor, someone speaks of something as if it were something else because there is something that they have in common. That is, in some way one thing is like the other thing. \n\nSometimes a speaker does this in ways that are very common in the language. At other times, a speaker does this in ways that are less common in the language and that might even be unique. Speakers usually use metaphors in order to make their language more vivid or to give their language more emotional impact.\n\n**Very Common (\"Dead\") Metaphors**\n\nThe metaphors that are very common in a language are usually not very vivid. They may even be \"dead.\" A \"dead\" metaphor is a metaphor that has been used so much in the language that the speakers of the language do not think of it as a metaphor. Examples in English are \"table leg,\" \"family tree,\" and \"the price of food is going up.\" Examples in biblical languages are \"hand\" to mean \"power,\" \"face\" to mean \"presence,\" and \"clothing\" to mean emotions or moral qualities. \n\nMetaphors like these are in constant use in the world's languages, because they serve as convenient ways to organize thought. In general, languages speak of abstract qualities, such as power, presence, emotions, and moral qualities, as if they were objects that can be seen or held, or as if they were body parts, or as if they were events that you can watch happen. \n\nWhen these metaphors are used in their normal ways, the speaker and audience of that language do not normally even regard them as figurative speech. It is just the normal way to say something in that language. This is why, for example, it would be wrong to translate the English expression, \"The price of petrol is going up\" into another language in a way that would draw special attention to it as figurative speech, because English speakers do not view it as a vivid expression. That is, it is not an unusual expression that carries meaning in an unusual manner. \n\nFor a description of important patterns of this kind of metaphor, please see [Biblical Imagery - Common Patterns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_bita_part1.md) and the pages it will direct you to. \n\n**Less Common (\"Live\") Metaphors** \n\nThis is the kind of metaphor that we usually think of when we talk about metaphors. This is the kind that we need to take special care to translate accurately. These metaphors are vivid and have emotional impact because they make comparisons that are unusual and that are sometimes even unique in a language. \n\nThe speaker usually produces metaphors of this kind in order to emphasize the importance of what he is talking about. For example, \n\n>For you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. (Malachi 4:2 ULB)\n\nHere God speaks about his salvation as if it were the sun rising to shine its rays on the people whom he loves. And he speaks of the sun's rays as if they were wings. Also, he speaks of these wings as if they were bringing medicine that would heal his people. \n\nWe call this kind of metaphor \"live.\" It is unique in the biblical languages, which means that it is very memorable. \n\n#### Parts of a Metaphor\n\nWhen talking about metaphors, it can be helpful to talk about their parts. A metaphor has three parts. \n\n1. **Topic** The thing someone speaks of is called the topic. \n1. **Image** The thing he calls it is the image. \n1. **Point of Comparison** The way that they are similar is the point of comparison. \n\nIn the metaphor below, the speaker describes the woman he loves as a rose. The woman (his \"love\") is the **topic** and the red rose is the **image**. The **point of comparison** is that both the woman and the rose are beautiful and delicate. \n\n  * My love is a red, red rose. \n\nNormally, as in the metaphor above, the speaker explicitly states the **topic** and the **image**, but he does not state the **point of comparison**. The speaker leaves it to the hearer to think of the **point of comparison**. In that way, the speaker's message has more impact on the hearer.\n\nAlso in the Bible, normally the **topic** and the **image** are stated clearly, but not the **point of comparison**. \n\n>Jesus said to them. \"**I am the bread of life**; he who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.\" (John 6:35 ULB)\n\nIn this metaphor, Jesus called himself the bread of life. The **topic** is \"I\" and the **image** is \"bread.\" Bread is a food that people ate all the time. The **point of comparison** is that people need both to live. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.\n\n#### Purposes of this second kind of Metaphor\n\n  * One purpose of metaphor is to teach people about something that they do not know (the **topic**) by showing that it is like something that they already do know (the **image**).\n  * Another purpose  is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to show that it has that quality in an extreme way.\n  * Another purpose is to lead people to feel the same way about the one thing as they would feel about the other.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * People may not recognize that something is a metaphor. In other words, they may mistake a metaphor for a literal statement, and thus misunderstand it.\n  * People may not be familiar with the thing that is used as an image, and so not be able to understand the metaphor. \n  * If the topic is not stated, people may not know what the topic is.\n  * People may not know the point of comparison, that is, they may not know how the topic and the image are alike, and so they will not understand the metaphor.\n\n#### Translation Principles\n\n  * Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.\n  * Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Listen to this word, **you cows of Bashan**, (Amos 4:1 ULB)\n\nIn this metaphor Amos compares the upper-class women of Samaria (the topic is \"you\") with cows (the image). The point of comparison is not stated, but from the context it seems that it is that both are fat and only interested in feeding themselves.\n\n>And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the **clay**. You are our **potter**; and we all are the work of your hand. (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)\n\nThe example above has two related metaphors. The topics are \"we\" and \"you\" and the images are \"clay and \"potter.\" The point of comparison is the relationship between the clay and the potter being similar to the relationship between us and God. Just as a potter takes clay and forms a jar or dish out of it, God makes us into what he wants us to be.\n\n>Jesus said to them, \"Take heed and beware of **the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees**.\" The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, \"It is because we took no bread.\" (Matthew 16:6-7 ULB)\n\nJesus used a metaphor here, but his disciples did not realize it. When he said \"yeast,\" they thought he was talking about bread, but \"yeast\" was the image in his metaphor, and the topic was the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Since the disciples (the original audience) did not understand what Jesus meant, it would not be good to state clearly here what Jesus meant.\n\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, go ahead and use it. Be sure to test the translation to make sure that people do understand it. If people do not or would not understand it, here are some other strategies.\n\n1. If the metaphor is common and seems to be a normal way to say something in the source language (a \"dead\" metaphor), express the main idea in the simplest way preferred by your language. \n2. If the metaphor seems to be a \"live\" metaphor, you can translate it literally if you think that the target language also uses this metaphor. If you do this, be sure to test it to make sure that the language community understands it correctly. \n3. If the target audience does not understand the metaphor correctly, then change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding words such as \"like\" or \"as.\" See [Simile](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_simile.md)\n4. If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md) for ideas on how to translate that image.\n5. If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. \n6. If the target audience would not know what the **topic** is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)\n7. If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, then state the **point of comparison** clearly.\n8. If none of these strategies are satisfactory, then just state the idea plainly without using a metaphor.\n\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If the metaphor is common and seems to be a normal way to say something in the source language (a \"dead\" metaphor), express the main idea in the simplest way preferred by your language.\n  * **And his brethren also went and _fell down before his face_;**  (Genesis 50:18 ASV)\n     * Then his brothers also went and **immediately bowed down in front of him**;\n\n2. If the metaphor seems to be a \"live\" metaphor, you can translate it literally if you think that the target language also uses this metaphor. If you do this, be sure to test it to make sure that the language community understands it correctly. \n  * **\"It was because of your _hard hearts_ that he wrote you this law,\"**  (Mark 10:5 ULB)\n     * \"It was because of your **hard hearts** that he wrote you this law,\" \nThere is no change to this one - but it must be tested to make sure that the target audience correctly understands this metaphor.\n\n3. If the target audience does not understand the metaphor correctly, then change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding words such as \"like\" or \"as.\"\n  * **And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the _clay_. You are our _potter_; and we all are the work of your hand.** (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)\n     *  \"And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are **like** clay. You are **like** a potter; and we all are the work of your hand.\"\n  \n4. If the target audience would not know the **image**, see [Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md) for ideas on how to translate that image.\n  * **Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you _to kick a goad_.** (Acts 26:14 ULB)\n     * \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to **kick against a pointed stick**.\"\n\n5. If the target audience would not use that **image** for that meaning, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times. \n  * **And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the _clay_. You are our _potter_; and we all are the work of your hand.** (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)\n     * \"And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the **wood**. You are our **carver**; and we all are the work of your hand.\"\n     * \"And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the **string**. You are the **weaver**; and we all are the work of your hand.\"\n\n6. If the target audience would not know what the **topic** is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)\n  * **Yahweh lives; may _my rock_ be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.** (Psalm 18:46 ULB)\n     * \"Yahweh lives; **He is my rock**. May he be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.\n\n7. If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, then state the **point of comparison** clearly.\n  * **Yahweh lives; may _my rock_ be praised. May the God of my salvation be exalted.** (Psalm 18:46 ULB)\n     * \"Yahweh lives; may he be praised because he is the rock **under which I can hide from my enemies**. May the God of my salvation be exalted.\" \n  *  **Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you _to kick a goad_.** (Acts 26:14 ULB)\n     * \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

It is not the same in all languages. Translators need to know what the normal word order is in their language.\n\n### The Main Parts of a Sentence\n\nMost sentences have three basic important parts: subject, object, and verb. Subjects and objects are usually nouns (i.e., a person, place, thing, or idea) or pronouns. Verbs show action or a state of being.\n\n#### Subject\n\nThe subject is usually what the sentence is about. It usually performs some action or is being described. \nA subject may be **active**: it does something, such as sing, or work, or teach.\n\n  * <u>Peter</u> sings the song well.\n\nA subject may have something done to it.\n\n  * <u>Peter</u> was fed good food.\n\nA subject can be described or it can be in a **state**, such as being happy, sad, or angry. \n\n  * <u>He</u> is tall.\n  * <u>The boy</u> is happy.\n\n#### Object\n\nThe **object** is often the thing that the subject does something to. \n\n  * Peter hit <u>the ball</u>. \n  * Peter read <u>a book</u>.\n  * Peter sang <u>the song</u> well. \n  * Peter ate <u>good food</u>.\n\n#### Verb\n\nThe verb shows an action or a state of being.\n\n  * Peter <u>sings</u> the song well.\n  * Peter <u>is singing</u>.\n  * Peter <u>is</u> tall.\n\n#### Preferred Word Order\n\nAll languages have a preferred word order. The examples below show the order of the subject, object, and verb in \"Peter hit the ball\" for some languages.\nIn some languages, such as English, the order is Subject-Verb-Object.\n\n  * Peter hit the ball.\n\nIn some languages the order is Subject-Object-Verb.\n\n  * Peter the ball hit.\n\nIn some languages the order is Verb-Subject-Object.\n\n  * Hit Peter the ball.\n\n#### Changes in Word Order\n\nWord order can change if the sentence:\n\n  * is a question or command\n  * describes a state of being (He is happy. He is tall)\n  * expresses a condition, such as with the the word \"if\"\n  * has a location\n  * has a time element\n  * is in a poem\n\nWord order can also change \n\n  * if there is some kind of emphasis on a certain part of the sentence\n  * if the sentence is really about something other than the subject\n\n### Translation Principles\n\n  * Know which word order is preferred in your language.\n  * Use your language's preferred word order unless there is some reason in your language to change it.\n  * Translate the sentence so that the meaning is accurate and clear and so that it sounds natural.\n\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at http://ufw.io/figs_order.\n\n",

Though the events in a parable could happen, they did not actually happen. They are told only to teach a truth. Parables rarely contain the names of specific people. (This may help you identify what is a parable and what is an account of a real event.) Parables often have figures of speech such as simile and metaphor. \n>Then he also told them a parable. \"Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not?\" (Luke 6:39 ULB)\n\nThis parable teaches that if a person does not have spiritual understanding, he cannot help someone else to understand spiritual things. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:15-16 ULB)\n\nThis parable teaches us not to hide the way we live for God from other people.    \n>Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.\" (Matthew 13:31-32 ULB)\n\nThis parable teaches that the kingdom of God may seem small at first, but it will grow and spread throughout the world.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. If a parable is hard to understand because it has unknown things in it, you can replace the unknown things with things that people in your culture know. However, be careful to keep the teaching the same. (See: [Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md))\n  1. If the teaching of the parable is unclear, consider telling a little about what it teaches in the introduction, such as \"Jesus told this story about being generous.\"\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1.

Speakers use rhetorical questions to express deep emotion or to encourage hearers to think deeply about something. The Bible contains many rhetorical questions, often to express surprise, to rebuke or scold the hearer, or to teach. Speakers of some languages use rhetorical questions for other reasons as well.\n\n### Description\n\nA rhetorical question is a question to which the speaker does not expect an answer because he is not looking for information. Speakers often use rhetorical questions to rebuke or scold people. \n\n>Those who stood by said, \"__Is this how you insult God's high priest?__\" (Acts 23:4 ULB)\n\nThe people did not ask this question in order to get information. Rather they used it to scold Paul because they did not think he should have spoken as he did to the high priest.\n\nThe Bible contains many rhetorical questions. Some of the purposes of these rhetorical questions are to remind people of something that they already know, to express strong emotion, to say something in a strong way, or to introduce something they want to talk about. \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * Some languages do not use rhetorical questions; for them a question is always a request for information. \n  * Some languages use rhetorical questions, but for purposes that are more limited or different than in the Bible.\n  * Because of these differences between languages, some readers might misunderstand the purpose of a rhetorical question in the Bible.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel? (1 Kings 21:7 ULB)\n\n\nJezebel used the question above to remind King Ahab of something he already knew: he still ruled the kingdom of Israel. The rhetorical question made her point more strongly than if she had merely stated it, because it forced Ahab to admit the point himself. She did this in order to rebuke him for being unwilling to take over a poor man's property. She was implying that since he was the king of Israel he had the power to take the man's property.\n\n>_Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils?_ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number! (Jeremiah 2:32 ULB)\n\n\nGod used the question above to remind his people of something they already knew: a young woman would never forget her jewelry or a bride forget her veils.  He then rebuked his people for forgetting him, who is so much greater than those things.\n\n>Why did I not die when I came out from the womb? (Job 3:11 ULB)\n\n\nJob used the question above to show deep emotion. This rhetorical question expresses how sad he was that he did not die as soon as he was born. He wished that he had not lived.\n\n>And why has it happened to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? (Luke 1:43 ULB)\n\n\nElizabeth used the question above to show how surprised and happy she was that the mother of her Lord came to her.\n\n>Or what man among you is there who, if his son asks him for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? (Matthew 7:9 ULB)\n\n\nJesus used the question above to remind the people of something they already knew: a good father would never give his son something bad to eat. By introducing this point, Jesus could go on to teach them about God with his next rhetorical question:\n\n>Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give good things to those who ask him? (Matthew 7:11 ULB)\n\n\nJesus used this question to teach the people in an emphatic way that God gives good things to those who ask him.\n\n>_What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to?_ It is like a mustard seed that a man took and threw into his garden... (Luke 13:18-19 ULB) \n\n\nJesus used the question above to introduce what he was going to talk about. He was going to compare the kingdom of God to something.\n\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n\nIn order to translate a rhetorical question accurately, first be sure that the question you are translating truly is a rhetorical question and is not an information question. Ask yourself, \"Does the person asking the question already know the answer to the question?\" If so, it is a rhetorical question. Or, if no one answers the question, is the one who asked it bothered that he did not get an answer? If not, it is a rhetorical question. When you are sure that the question is rhetorical, then be sure that you know what the purpose of the rhetorical question is. Is it to encourage or rebuke or shame the hearer? Is it to bring up a new topic? Is it to do something else? When you know the purpose of the rhetorical question, then think of the most natural way to express that purpose in the target language. It might be as a question, or a statement, or an exclamation.\n\nIf using the rhetorical question would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing so. If not, here are other options:\n\n1. Add the answer after the question.\n1. Change the rhetorical question to a statement or exclamation.\n1. Change the rhetorical question to a statement, and then follow it with a short question.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Add the answer after the question.\n  * **Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils? Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number!** (Jeremiah 2:32 ULB)\n      * \"Will a virgin forget her jewelry, a bride her veils? _Of course not!_ Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number!\"\n\n  * **Or what man among you is there who, if his son asks him for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone?** (Matthew 7:9 ULB)\n      * \"Or what man among you is there who, if his son asks him for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? __None of you would do that!__\"\n\n2. Change the rhetorical question to a statement or exclamation.\n  * **What is the kingdom of God like, and what can I compare it to? It is like a mustard seed...**  (Luke 13:18-19 ULB) \n      * \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. It is like a mustard seed...\"\n\n  * **Is this how you insult God's high priest?** (Acts 23:4 ULB)\n      * \"You should not insult God's high priest!'\"\n \n  * **Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?** (Job 3:11 ULB)\n      * \"I wish I had died when I came out from the womb!\"\n\n  * **And why has it happened to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?** (Luke 1:43 ULB)\n      * \"How wonderful it is that the mother of my Lord has come to me!\"\n\n3. Change the rhetorical question to a statement, and then follow it with a short question.\n  * **Do you not still rule the kingdom of Israel?** (1 Kings 21:7 ULB)\n      * \"You still rule the kingdom of Israel, __do you not__?\"\n\n",

It focuses on a particular trait the two items have in common, and it includes the words \"like,\" \"as\" or \"than.\"\n>When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were worried and confused, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. (Matthew 9:36)\n\nJesus compared the crowds of people to sheep without a shepherd. Sheep  grow frightened when they do not have a good shepherd to lead them in safe places. The crowds were like that because they did not have good religious leaders. \n>See, I send you out <u>as sheep in the midst of wolves</u>, so be as  wise <u>as  serpents</u> and harmless <u>as  doves</u>. (Matthew 10:16 ULB)\n\nJesus compared his disciples to sheep and their enemies to wolves. Wolves attack sheep. Jesus' enemies would attack his disciples.\n>For the word of God is living and active and sharper <u>than any two-edged sword</u>. (Hebrews 4:12 ULB)\n\nGod's word is compared to a two-edged sword. A two-edged sword is a weapon that can easily cut through a person's flesh. God's word is very effective in showing what is in a person's heart and thoughts.\n\n#### Purposes of Simile\n\n  * A simile can teach about something that is unknown by showing how it is similar to something that is known.\n  * A simile can emphasize a particular trait, sometimes in a way that gets people's attention.\n  * Similes help form a picture in the mind or help the reader experience what he is reading about more fully.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * People may not know how the two items are similar.\n  * People may not be familiar with the item that something is compared to.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Suffer hardship with me,  <u>as a good soldier of Christ Jesus</u>.  (2 Timothy 2:3 ULB)\n\nIn this simile, Paul compares suffering with what soldiers endure, and he encourages Timothy to follow their example.\n>for <u> as the lightning appears when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky</u>, so will the Son of Man be in his day.  (Luke 17:24 ULB)\n\nThis verse does not tell how the Son of Man will be like the lightening. But from the context we can understand from the verses before it that just as lighting flashes suddenly and everyone can see it, the Son of Man will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf people would understand the correct meaning of a simile, consider using it. If they would not, here are some strategies you can use:\n\n  1. If people do not know how the two items are alike, tell how they are alike. However, do not do this if the meaning was not clear to the original audience.\n  1. If people are not familiar with the item that something is compared to, use an item from your own culture.

Some languages also have a **dual** form of \"you\" for when the word \"you\" refers to only two people. Translators who speak one of these languages will always need to know what the speaker meant so they can choose the right word for \"you\" in their language. Other languages, such as English, have only one form, which people use regardless of how many people it refers to.\n\nThe Bible was first written in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. These languages all have a singular form of \"you\" and a plural form of \"you.\" When we read the Bible in those languages, the pronouns and verb forms show us whether the word \"you\" refers to one person or more than one person. However, they do not show us whether it refers to only two people or more than two people. When the pronouns do not show us how many people the word \"you\" refers to, we need to look at the context to see how many people the speaker was speaking to.\n\n#### Reasons this is a Translation Issue\n\n  * Translators who speak a language that has distinct singular, dual, and plural forms of \"you\" will always need to know what the speaker meant so they can choose the right word for \"you\" in their language.\n  * Many languages also have different forms of the verb depending on whether the subject is singular or plural. So even if there is no pronoun meaning \"you,\" translators of these languages will need to know if the speaker was referring to one person or more than one.\n\nOften the context will make it clear whether the word \"you\" refers to one person or more than one. If you look at the other pronouns in the sentence, they will help you know how many people the speaker was addressing.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n><u>James and John</u>, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said, \"Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.\" He [Jesus] said to them, \"What do <u>you </u> want me to do for <u>you</u>?\" (Mark 10:35-36 ULB)\n\nJesus is asking the **two**, James and John, what they want him to do for them. If the target language has a **dual** form of \"you,\" use that. If the target language does not have a dual form, then the plural form would be appropriate. \n\n>… and Jesus sent out two of his disciples and said to them, \"Go into the village opposite us. As soon as  <u>you</u> enter it,  <u>you</u> will find a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.  (Mark 11:1-2 ULB)\n\nThe context makes it clear that Jesus is addressing **two** people. If the target language has a **dual** form of \"you,\" use that. If the target language does not have a dual form, then the plural form would be appropriate. \n\n>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes of the Dispersion, greetings. Consider it all joy, my brothers, when <u>you</u> experience various troubles, knowing that the testing of <u>your</u> faith works endurance.  (James 1:1-3 ULB)\n\nJames wrote this letter to many people, so the word \"you\" refers to many people. If the target language has a **plural** form of \"you,\" it would be best to use it here.\n\n### Strategies for finding out how many people \"you\" refers to\n\n  1. Look at the notes to see if they tell whether \"you\" refers to one person or more than one person.\n  1. Look at the UDB to see if it says anything that would show you whether the word \"you\" refers to one person or more than one person.\n  1. If you have a Bible that is written in a language that distinguishes \"you\" singular from \"you\" plural, see which form of \"you\" that Bible has in that sentence. \n  1. Look at the context to see who the speaker was talking to and who responded.\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at http://ufw.io/figs_youdual.\n\n",

Translators who speak one of these languages will always need to know what the speaker meant so they can choose the right word for \"you\" in their language. Other languages, such as English, have only one form, which people use regardless of how many people it refers to.\n\nThe Bible was first written in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages. These languages all have both a singular form of \"you\" and a plural form of \"you.\" When we read the Bible in those languages, the pronouns and verb forms show us whether the word \"you\" refers to one person or more than one. When we read the Bible in a language that does not have different forms of you, we need to look at the context to see how many people the speaker was speaking to.\n\n#### Reason this is a Translation Issue\n\n  * Translators who speak a language that has distinct singular and plural forms of \"you\" will always need to know what the speaker meant so they can choose the right word for \"you\"  in their language. \n  * Many languages also have different forms of the verb depending on whether the subject is singular or plural. So even if there is no pronoun meaning \"you\", translators of these languages will need to know if the speaker was referring to one person or more than one.\nOften the context will make it clear whether the word \"you\" refers to one person or more than one. If you look at the other pronouns in the sentence, they will help you know the number of people the speaker was speaking to.\nSometimes Greek and Hebrew speakers used \"you\" singular even though they were speaking to a group of people. See [Forms of 'You' - Singular to a Crowd](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_youcrowd.md)\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>The ruler said, \"All these things I have obeyed from the time I was a youth.\" When Jesus heard that, he said to him, \"One thing  <u>you</u> still lack.  <u>You</u> must sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and  <u>you</u> will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.\" (Luke 18:21, 22 ULB)\n\nThe ruler was speaking about just himself when he said \"I.\" This shows us that when Jesus said \"you\" he was referring only to the ruler. So languages that have singular and plural forms of \"you\" would have the singular form here. \n>The angel said to him, \"Dress  <u>yourself</u> and put on  <u>your</u> sandals.\" Peter did so. The angel said to him, \"Put on  <u>your</u> outer garment and follow me.\" So Peter followed the angel and went out. (Acts 12:8, ULB)\n\nThe context makes it clear that the angel was speaking to one person and that only one person did what the the angel commanded. So languages that have singular and plural forms of \"you\" would have the singular form here for \"yourself\" and \"your\". Also, if verbs have different forms for singular and plural subjects, the verbs \"dress\" and \"put on\" will need the form for \"you\" singular.\n>To Titus, a true son in our common faith. ... For this purpose I left <u>you</u> in Crete, that <u>you</u> might set in order things not yet complete, and ordain elders in every city as I directed <u>you</u>. … But  <u>you</u>, say what agrees with healthy doctrine. (Titus 1:4,5; 2:1 ULB)\n\nPaul wrote this letter to one person, Titus. Most of the time the word \"you\" in this letter refers only to Titus.\n\n#### Strategies for finding out how many people \"you\" refers to\n\n  1. Look at the notes to see if they tell whether \"you\" refers to one person or more than one person.\n  1. Look at the UDB to see if it says anything that would show you whether the word \"you\" refers to one person or more than one person.\n  1. If you have a Bible that is written in a language that distinguishes \"you\" singular from \"you\" plural, see which form of \"you\" that Bible has in that sentence. \n  1. Look at the context to see how many people the speaker was talking to and who responded.\n\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at http://ufw.io/figs_younum.\n\n",

From creating alphabets, typing, typesetting, formatting, publishing, and distributing, there are many technical aspects to translation. In order to make all this possible, there are some standards that have been adopted. \n\n### USFM: Bible Translation Format\n\nFor many years, the standard format for Bible translation has been USFM (which stands for Unified Standard Format Markers). We have adopted this standard as well. \n\nUSFM is a type of markup language that tells a computer program how to format the text. For instance, each chapter is marked like this ''\\c 1'' or ''\\c 33''. Verse markers might look like ''\\v 8'' or ''\\v 14''. Paragraphs are marked ''\\p''. There are many other markers like this that have specific meaning. So a passage like John 1:1-2 in USFM will look like this: \n\n    \\c 1\n    \\p\n    \\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n    \\v 2 This one, the Word, was in the beginning with God.\n\nWhen a computer program that can read USFM sees this, it is able to format all of the chapter markers the same way (for instance, with a larger number) and all the verse numbers the same way (for instance, with a small superscript number). \n\n***Bible translations must be in USFM for us to be able to use it!***\n\nTo read more about USFM notation, please read http://paratext.org/about/usfm .\n\n#### How To Do a Bible Translation in USFM\n\nMost people do not know how to write in USFM. This is one of the reasons why we created translationStudio (http://ufw.io/ts/). When you do a translation in translationStudio, what you see looks very similar to a normal word processor document without any markup language. However, translationStudio is formatting the Bible translation in USFM underneath what you see. This way, when you upload your translation from translationStudio, what is being uploaded is already formatted in USFM and can be immediately published in a variety of formats.\n\n#### Converting a Translation to USFM\n\nThough it is strongly encouraged to only do a translation using USFM notation, sometimes a translation is done without using USFM markup. This type of translation still can be used, but first the USFM markers must be added. One way to do this is to copy and paste it into translationStudio, then place the verse markers in the correct place. When this is done, the translation will be able to be exported as USFM. This is a very arduous task, so we strongly recommend doing your Bible translation work from the beginning in translationStudio or some other program that uses USFM. \n\n\n### Markdown for Other Content\n\nMarkdown is a very common markup language that is used in many places on the Internet.  Using Markdown makes it very easy for the same text to be used in a variety of formats (such as webpage, mobile app, PDF, etc).\n\nMarkdown supports **bold** and *italic*, written like this:\n\n        Markdown supports **bold** and *italic*.\n\nMarkdown also supports headings like this:\n\n            # Heading 1\n            ## Heading 2\n            ### Heading 3\n\nMarkdown also supports links. Links display like this https://unfoldingword.org and are written like this:\n\n            https://unfoldingword.org\n\nCustomized wording for links are also supported, like this:\n\n            [uW Website](https://unfoldingword.org)\n\nNote that HTML is also valid Markdown.  For a complete listing of Markdown syntax please visit http://ufw.io/md.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe easiest way to get content marked up with USFM or Markdown is by using an editor that is specifically designed to do that. If a word processor or a text editor is used, these markings must be manually entered. \n\n*Note: Making text bold, italic, or underlined in a word processor does not make it bold, italic, or underlined in a markup language. This type of formatting must be done by writing the designated symbols.*\n\nWhen contemplating which software to use, please keep in mind that translation is not just about words; there are a lot of technical aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Whatever software is used, just remember that Bible translations need to be put into USFM, and everything else needs to be put into Markdown. \n\n",

If you are translating the Bible, read the entire chapter before you start to translate any part of it. This way you will understand how the part you are translating fits into the larger context, and you will translate it better.\n* Read the passage that you plan to translate in as many different translations as you have. The ULB will help you to see the form of the original text, and the UDB will help you to understand the meaning of the original text. Think about how to communicate the meaning in the form that people would use in your language. Also read any Bible helps or commentaries that you have that talk about that passage.\n* Read the translationNotes for the passage that you plan to translate.\n* Read the definitions of important terms in the list called \"translationWords\" for each highlighted word in the passage that you plan to translate.\n* Discuss the passage, the translationNotes, and the translationWords with others in the translation team.\n* When you understand well what the passage is saying, write down (or record) what it is saying in your language, in the way that someone from your language community would say it. Write down (or record) the whole passage (the chunk of text) without looking at the source text. This will help you to say these things in a way that is natural for your language, rather than in a way that was natural for the source language but that is not the best way to say it in your language.\n",

Here are some steps to follow:\n\n   * Discover the meaning of a passage.\n   * Identify the main idea.\n   * Translate with the author's message in mind.\n\n#### Discover the Meaning\n\nFirst, read each passage a few times to discover the meaning. Use the two versions of the Bible available in translationStudio: the Unlocked Dynamic Bible and the Unlocked Literal Bible. Also read the definitions of the translationWords and the translationNotes.\n\nFirst read the Unlocked Literal Bible:\n>\"Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you, and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'\" (Luke 10:8-9 ULB)\n\nLook at the Unlocked Dynamic Bible in the translationHelps:\n>\"Whenever you enter a town and the people there welcome you, eat whatever food they provide for you. Heal the people there who are sick. Tell them, 'The kingdom of God is right here near you.'\" (Luke 10:8-9 UDB)\n\nDo you notice the differences? There are some differences in the words each Bible version uses.\n\nDid you discover the meaning is the same? In both versions Jesus is giving specific instructions, and they are the same instructions. Both versions are accurate translations.\n\n#### Identify the Main Idea\n\nThen, after discovering the meaning of the passage, you should identify the main idea.\n\nAsk yourself, \"Why is the author writing this, and how does he feel about these things?\"\n\nLook at the Luke 10 passage again. Why do you think the author is writing this? What do you think the author feels about what he wrote? What do you think? After you have read the passage several times, answer these questions:\n\n  * What is happening? *Jesus gave instructions.*\n  * When and where did these things take place? *To answer this question, you would need to remember what happened earlier. Earlier Luke writes that Jesus and the disciples are on the way to Jerusalem and chapter 10 starts with Jesus sending out 72 people to preach.*\n  * Who is involved in this passage? *Jesus and the 72 people he sent out.*\n  * Why were the 72 sent out? *To heal the sick and to tell everyone that the kingdom of God is near.*\n\n#### The Message of the Writer\n\nFinally, part of translating the source text accurately is to think of the original audience and the message of the writer.\n\nDo you think the author had specific things for the reader to know? Remember what we thought the author's main ideas were? The main ideas were:\n\n   * The instructions that Jesus gave.\n   * That the 72 people whom Jesus sent out would have power to heal sick people.\n   * That they would tell others that the kingdom of God was near.\n\nThis is the message to the original audience. Allow the same message to come clearly into your mind in the target language.\n\nLook at the passage and think how you would retell it in your own language. Keep this initial translation by writing it down. Use an alphabet that suits your language.\n\n**Remember:** Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.\n\n\n",

All three of these directly affect the words and phrases that are used in the translation. If a translation is not one of these three, simply changing or reordering the words that were used can often fix the problem. The fourth quality, church-approved, has less to do with the words used and more to do with the process that is used. \n\n### The Goal of Translation\n\nThe goal of the translation of biblical content is not only to produce a high-quality translation, but to produce a high-quality translation that is used and loved by the church. High-quality translations must be clear, natural, and accurate. But for a translation to be used and loved by the church, it must be church-approved. \n\n### How to Create a Church-Approved Translation\n\nCreating a church-approved translation is all about the process of translation, checking, and distribution. The more church networks that are involved in these processes, the more likely they will approve of the translation.\n\nBefore starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. \n\nIt is not necessary that the church actively lead the translation and coordinate all the efforts, but it is necessary that whoever is leading the translation be approved by the church networks, preferably before they even start. \n\n### Church Approval and the Checking Levels\n\nThe need for church-approval of a translation is clearly reflected in the Checking Levels. In fact, the Checking Levels are largely a measurement of how broadly the church approves of the translation. \n\n  * Level 1 states that the church-approved translation team has approved the translation. \n  * Level 2 states that the pastors and leaders of local churches approve the translation.\n  * Level 3 states that leaders of multiple church networks approve of the translation. \n\nAt each level, the people leading the translation should encourage participation and input from the church networks. By using this process, we hope to encourage church ownership of the translation among as many church networks as possible. With this approval, there should be nothing hindering the translation from being used to strengthen and encourage the church. \n\n",

This includes putting the text into a different form or arrangement and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible. \n\nThese guidelines are for Other Language translations, not for Gateway Language translations. When translating the ULB into a Gateway Language, you should not make these changes. It is not necessary to make these changes when translating the UDB into a Gateway Language, because they have already been done. Here are some ideas to create a clear translation from the source text:\n\n#### Check Pronouns\n\nYou will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.\n\nAlways check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. If it is not clear, it may be necessary to put in the name of a person or thing instead of a pronoun.\n\n#### Identify Participants\n\nNext you need to understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the **participants**. The **participants** in an event are the people or things that take part in that event. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it are the main **participants**. When re-expressing an **event** idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the **participants** in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.\n\n#### Clearly Express Event Ideas\n\nMany **event** ideas may occur as nouns in the Gateway Language. A clear translation may need to express these **event** ideas as verbs.  \n\nWhen preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any **event** ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the **event** idea. If, however, your language also uses nouns to express **event** ideas and the event or action sounds more natural as a noun, then use the noun form. See [Abstract Nouns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_abstractnouns.md)\n\nYou may also need to change each **event** idea into an active clause to be sure it is understood.\n\n#### Passive Verbs\n\nA clear translation may need to change any **passive** verbs to the **active** form. See [Active or Passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_activepassive.md)\n\nIn the **active** form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the **passive** form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. For example, \"John hit Bill\" is an active sentence. \"Bill was hit by John\" is a passive sentence.\n\nMany languages do not have a **passive** form, only the **active** form exists. In this case, it would be necessary to turn a sentence from the **passive** form into the **active** form. Some languages, however, prefer to use **passive** forms. Translators should use the forms that are most natural in the target language.\n\n#### Look at Each 'Of' Phrase\n\nTo make a clear translation, you will also need to look at each \"of\" phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by \"of.\" In many languages, \"of\" constructions are not as frequent as they are in the original languages of the Bible. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the \"of\" phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.\n\nAfter you have checked these things and made your translation as clear as possible, you will need to read it to other people who speak your language to see if it is clear to them. If there are parts that they do not understand, it may be because that part is not clear. Together, you can think of a clearer way to say that part. Keep checking the translation with many people until all of it is clear.\n\nRemember: Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.\n\n#### Writing Clearly\n\nAsking yourself these questions can also help you to create a translation that communicates clearly: \n\n  * Have you used punctuation to help a reader know when to pause or breathe?  \n  * Have you indicated which parts are direct speech?  \n  * Are you separating paragraphs?\n  * Have you considered adding section headings?\n",

It must be:\n\n  * Clear - see [Create Clear Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_clear.md)\n  * Natural - see [Create Natural Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_natural.md)\n  * Accurate - see [Create Accurate Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_accurate.md)\n  * Church-Approved - see [Create Church-Approved Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_church_approved.md)\n\nWe can think of each of these qualities as a leg of a four-legged stool. Each one is necessary. If one is missing, the stool will not stand. Likewise, each of these qualities must be present in a translation in order for it to be useful and faithful to the church. \n\n#### Clear\n\nUse whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes simplifying concepts, rearranging the form of a text, and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible. To learn how to make Clear Translations, see [Create Clear Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_clear.md).\n\n#### Natural\n\nUse language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts. To learn how to make Natural Translations, see [Create Natural Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_natural.md).\n\n#### Accurate\n\nTranslate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. Translate with the meaning of the text in mind and communicate accurately the implicit information, unknown concepts, and figures of speech. To learn how to make Accurate Translations, see [Create Accurate Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_accurate.md).\n\n#### Church-Approved\n\nIf a translation is clear, natural, and accurate but the church does not approve of it or accept it, then it does not achieve the final goal of edifying the church. It is important that the church be involved in the translation, checking, and distribution of the translation. To learn how to make Church-Approved Translations, see [Create Church-Approved Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_church_approved.md).\n\n### Six Other Qualities\n\nIn addition to being clear, natural, accurate, and church-approved, great translations should also be:\n\n  * Faithful - see [Create Faithful Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/guidelines_faithful.md)\n  * Authoritative - see [Create Authoritative Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/guidelines_authoritative.md)\n  * Historical - see [Create Historical Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/guidelines_historical.md)\n  * Equal - see [Create Equal Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/guidelines_equal.md)\n  * Collaborative - see [Create Collaborative Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/guidelines_collaborative.md)\n  * Ongoing - see [Create Ongoing Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/guidelines_ongoing.md)\n\n",

Here are some ideas for making a natural translation:\n\n#### Use Short Sentences\n\nIn order for a translation to sound natural, sometimes it is necessary to create shorter, simpler sentences from longer, complex ones. The Greek language often has long, grammatically complicated sentences. Some Bible translations follow the Greek structure closely and keep these long sentences in their translation, even when this does not sound natural or is confusing in the target language. \n\nWhen preparing to translate, it is often helpful to rewrite the passage, breaking long sentences up into shorter sentences. This can help you to see the meaning more clearly and translate it better. In many languages, it is good style to have shorter sentences, or, when sentences are longer, to avoid having complicated sentences. So in re-expressing the meaning in the Target Language, it is sometimes necessary to break up some of the original long sentences into several shorter sentences. Because many languages use sentences with only one or two clause groupings, the shorter sentences will give a sense of naturalness. The shorter sentences will also give readers a better understanding, because the meaning will be clearer. Be sure to include clear connection words between the new, shorter clauses and sentences.\n\nTo make shorter sentences from longer, more complex sentences, identify the words in the sentence that relate directly to each other, that is, that belong together to form a clause. Generally, each verb or action word has words on either side of it that point back to or forward to the action of the verb. A grouping of words like this that can stand on its own may be written as an independent clause or a simple sentence. Keep each of those groups of words together and in that way divide the sentence into its separate ideas or parts. Read the new sentences to make sure they still make sense. If there is a problem, you may need to divide the long sentence in a different way. When you understand the message of the new sentences, translate them into the target language, making sentences that are a natural length and connect them in a natural way. Then test your translation by reading it to a member of the language community to see if it sounds natural. \n\n#### Write the Way Your People Talk\n\nRead the passage or chapter of the Bible and ask yourself, \"what kind of message is this?\" Then translate that passage or chapter in the way that your language would communicate that kind of message.\n\nFor example, if the passage is a poem, such as in the Psalms, then translate it in the form that your people will recognize as a poem. \nOr if the passage is an exhortation about the right way to live, such as in the New Testament letters, then translate it in a form that people in your language exhort each other.\nOr if the passage is a story about what someone did, translate it in the form of a story (that really happened).\nThe Bible has a lot of these kinds of stories, and as part of these stories people say things to each other that also have their own form. For example, people make threats, give warnings, and praise or rebuke each other. To make your translation natural, you should translate each of these things in the way that people in your language make threats, give warnings, praise or rebuke each other, etc.\n\nIn order to know how to write these different things, you may have to listen to what people say around you, and practice writing down different things that people say and do, so that you become familiar with the form and words that people use for these different purposes.\n\nA good translation will use the same vocabulary and expressions as the people of the target group normally use. It should be easy for them to read it or listen to it. There should not be any awkward or strange phrases. The translation should read as easily as a letter from a close friend. \n\n#### Not for Gateway Language Translations\n\nThis section is not for Gateway Language translations of the ULB and UDB. These are Bibles that are designed to have characteristics that keep them from being natural in a target language. They are Bible translation tools, not end-user Bibles. For more information about this, see \"Translating the ULB\" and \"Translating the UDB\" in the Gateway Languages Manual.  \n\n\n",

The steps work together in sequence so that, when a translator follows them carefully, the outcome will be a draft that speaks naturally in the target language, and has been checked by several people to make sure that it communicates everything that the source text communicated.\n\n## Methodology Steps in MAST\n\nMAST methodology is comprised of eight steps. The first four describe the Drafting Steps and the last four describe the Checking Steps. \n\n### Drafting Steps\n\n  1. **Consume** - Take in the source text, usually one chapter at a time for scripture translation. For a written translation, the translator would read the chapter, and for an oral translation the translator would listen to the chapter. \n  1. **Verbalize** - Express what you just consumed to someone else. Tell this other person what the chapter is about. It is best if you can do this in the target language. This should not be a detailed discussion of the text in exegetical form. This should largely focus on the expression of the main points of the chapter.\n  1. **Chunk** - Group the text of the chapter into sections. These sentences in each section should fit together because of a shared topic, theme, or chain of logic. The sections should be bigger than sentences or verses,  often 2, 3, or 4 verses at a time. If you are translating in translationStudio from the ULB and UDB texts, you do not need to do this step because the chunking has been done for you. But if you would like to make different chunks than the ULB and UDB have, then go ahead and do so.\n  1. **Blind Draft** - Set aside the source text and draft the chunk as well as you can without looking back at the text. Write everything that you remember about that chunk. Do not look back at the source text for this chunk until you begin the checking steps. Continue doing this with each chunk of the chapter before moving to the checking steps. **Note:** This step should not be used for drafting Gateway Language materials such as the ULB, UDB, and translationNotes. Instead, draft these materials while looking at the source text.\n\n### Checking Steps\n\n  1. **Self edit** - The translator can now examine his newly drafted scripture chunks and compare them to the source text(s). Any error can be edited and corrected at this point. The key focus question at this step is, \"What did I miss?\" Anything that was missed in blind drafting should be added into the translation now, in the place where it is most natural in the target language.\n  1. **Peer edit** - When the translator has finished the self-edit step for the whole chapter, he should trade it for a chapter that another translator has finished self-editing. The translators will examine each other's chapter, looking for anything that seems unnatural as well as anything that seems to be inaccurate. When they find a problem, they should mark it and then discuss the problems and fix them together.  \n  1. **Keyword Check** - a facilitator, working with the translator, should examine each new drafted chapter for all key words in two steps:\n      1. The facilitator should ask if each key word is present in the newly translated scripture. If it is not, then it either needs to be added or there needs to be a good reason why it is not, such as the meaning being communicated by a different word or words.\n      1. The facilitator should ask the translator to provide a definition of each key word in the text and compare it to an already developed list of contextual definitions. These definitions should match. If they do not, the translation team needs to discuss which word is the best to use for the key term in this context. \n  1. **Verse-by-Verse Check** - a facilitator should examine each verse of the newly translated chapter and compare it to the source text to make sure that it accurately communicates the same message as the source and to verify with the translator that the verses flow naturally in the target language.\n",

These questions will help the church and community leaders know if the people that they choose will be able to successfully translate the Bible or the Open Bible Stories. \n\n  1. Is the person known to be a very good speaker of the target language? It is important that the person speak the target language very well.\n    * Can this person read and write the target language well?\n    * Has the person been living in the language community for much of his or her life? Someone who has lived away from the language area for a very long period of time might have difficulty making a natural translation.\n    * Do people respect the way this person speaks their own language? \n    * What is the age and local language background of each translator? It is usually good to have people from different places in the language area and of different ages, because people of different places and ages might use the language differently. These people then need to agree on a way to say things that sounds good to all of them.\n2. Does the person have a very good understanding of the source language?\n   * What level of education have they received, and how have they obtained skills in the source language?\n   * Does the Christian community recognize that this person has adequate skills to speak the source language and an education sufficient to use the Notes or other exegetical helps provided?\n   * Can the person read and write the source language with fluency and understanding?\n3. Is the person respected in the community as a follower of Christ? The person must be humble and willing to listen to suggestions or corrections from others concerning his or her translation work. The person must be always willing to learn from others.\n   * How long have they been a Christian, and are they in good standing with their Christian community? \n   * How has this person shown himself to be committed to Christ as a disciple? Bible translation is difficult, involves many revisions, and requires dedication to the task.\n\nAfter the translators have been working for awhile, the translation committee will need to make sure that they are working well. They may ask:\n\n  * Does their work meet the expectations of their fellow translators and local church leaders? (Has the translator been willing to work with others in testing and checking their translation?)\n",

The alternate translation should only be used when the ULB form or content would give a wrong meaning, or would be unclear or unnatural. \n\nThe alternate translation suggestion may involve, for example, stating implicit information clearly, changing passive voice to active, or rewording rhetorical questions as statements. The notes often explain why there is an alternate translation and have a link to a page that explains the topic.\n\n### Translation Notes Examples\n\nThe \"AT:\" indicates that this is an alternate translation. Some examples are:\n\n**Making Implicit Information Clear**\n\n>  it is the law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree or statute that the king issues can be changed. (Daniel 6:15 ULB)\n\n\n  * **no decree...can be changed** - An additional sentence may be added here to aid in understanding. AT: \"no decree...can be changed. So they must throw Daniel into the pit of lions.\" (See: *Explicit*)\n\nThe additional sentence shows what the speaker wanted the king to understand from his reminder that the king's decrees and statues cannot be changed. Translators may need to state some things clearly in the translation that the original speaker or writer left unstated or implicit. \n\n**Passive to Active**\n\n> to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. (Luke 12:10 ULB)\n\n\n  * **it will not be forgiven** - This can be expressed with an active verb. AT: God will not forgive him. This can also be expressed in a positive way using a verb that means the opposite of \"forgive.\" AT: \"God will consider him guilty forever\" (See: *Active Passive*)\n\nThis Note provides an example of how translators can translate this passive sentence if their languages do not use passive sentences.\n\n**Rhetorical Question**\n\n> Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? (Acts 9:4 ULB)\n\n\n  * **why are you persecuting me?** - This rhetorical question communicates a rebuke to Saul. In some languages a statement would be more natural (AT): \"You are persecuting me!\" or a command (AT): \"Stop persecuting me!\" (See: *Rhetorical Questions*)\n\nThe translation suggestion here provides an alternate way to translate (AT) the rhetorical question if your language does not use that form of rhetorical question to rebuke someone.\n\n\n",

If a meaning is given in a way that it can be used as a translation, it will have quote marks around it. \n\nThe translator needs to decide which meaning to translate. Translators may choose the first meaning, or they may choose one of the other meanings if the people in their community use and respect another Bible version that has one of those other meanings.\n\n### Translation Notes Examples\n\n> But take a small number of hairs from them and tie them into the folds of your robe. (Ezekiel 5:3 ULB)\n\n  * **the folds of your robe** -- Possible meanings are 1) \"the cloth on your arms\" (\"your sleeves\") (UDB) or 2) \"the end of the cloth on your robe\" (\"your hem\") or 3) the fold in the garment where it is tucked into the belt.\n\nThis note has the ULB text followed by three possible meanings. The word translated by \"the folds of your robe\" refers to the loose parts of the robe. Most scholars believe it refers here to the sleeves, but it could also refer to the loose part at the bottom or also to the folds in the middle, around the belt. \n\n> But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees (Luke 5:8 ULB)\n\n  * **fell down at Jesus' knees** - Possible meanings are 1) \"knelt down before Jesus\" or 2) \"bowed down at Jesus' feet\" or 3) \"lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet.\" Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of  humility and respect for Jesus. \n\nThis note explains what \"fell down at Jesus' knees\" might mean. The first meaning is most likely correct, but the other meanings are also possible. If your language does not have a general expression that could include various actions like these, you may need to choose one of these possibilities that describe more specifically what Simon Peter did. It is also helpful to think about why Simon Peter did this, and what kind of action would communicate the same attitude of humility and respect in your culture.\n\n\n",

This will be followed by a link to the information page called \"Direct and Indirect Quotations\" that explains both kinds of quotations.\n\nThere may be a note about direct and indirect quotes when a quote has another quote inside of it, because these can be confusing. In some languages it may be more natural to translate one of these quotes with a direct quote and the other quote with an indirect quote. The note will end with a link to the information page called \"[Quotes within Quotes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotesinquotes.md).\" \n\n### Translation Notes Examples\n\n> He instructed him to tell no one (Luke 5:14 ULB)\n\n  * **to tell no one**  - This can be translated as a direct quote: \"Do not tell anyone\" There is implied information that can also be stated explicitly (AT): \"do not tell anyone that you have been healed\" (See: [Direct and Indirect Quotations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotations.md) and [Ellipsis](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_ellipsis.md))\n\nHere the translationNote shows how to change the indirect quote to a direct quote, in case that would be clearer or more natural in the target language.  \n\n> At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, \"First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.\" (Matthew 13:30 ULB)\n\n  * **I will say to the reapers, \"First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn\"** - You can translate this as an indirect quote: \"I will tell the reapers to first gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, then gather the wheat into my barn.\" (See: [Direct and Indirect Quotations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotations.md))\n\nHere the translationNote shows how to change the direct quote to an indirect quote, in case that would be clearer or more natural in the target language.   \n",

Links to a translationAcademy topic page and links for repeated words or phrases within the same book.\n\n### translationAcademy Topics\n\nThe translationAcademy topics are intended to enable anyone, anywhere to learn the basics of how to translate the Bible into their own language. They are intended to be highly flexible for just-in-time learning in web and offline mobile video formats. \n\nEach translationNote follows a phrase from the ULB and will provide immediate help on how to translate that phrase. Sometimes there will be a statement in parenthesis at the end of the suggested translation that may look like this: (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md)). The word or words in green are a link to a translationAcademy topic.  You can click on the link to learn more about the topic. \n\nThere are several reasons to read the translationAcademy topic information:\n\n  * Learning about the topic will help the translator to translate more accurately.\n  * The topics have been chosen to provide a basic understanding of the principles and strategies of translation.\n\n#### Examples\n\n  * **evening and morning** - This refers to the whole day. Two parts of the day are used to refer to the whole day. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. (See: [Merism](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_merism.md))\n  * **walking** - \"obeying\" (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))\n  * **made it known** - \"communicated it\" (See: [Idiom](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_idiom.md))\n\n\n\n### Repeated Phrases in a Book\n\nSometimes a phrase is used multiple times in one book. When this happens, there will be a link in the translationNotes - green chapter and verse numbers that you can click on - that will take you back to where you have translated that phrase before.  There are several reasons why you will want to go to the place where the word or phrase was translated before:\n\n  * This will make it easier for you to translate this phrase by reminding you of how you have already translated it. \n  * This will make your translation faster and more consistent because you will be reminded to translate that phrase in the same way each time. \n\nIf a translation that you have used before for the same phrase does not fit a new context, then you will have to think of a new way to translate it. In this case, you should make a note of it and discuss it with others on the translation team. \n\nThese links will only take you back to notes in the book that you are working on. \n\n#### Examples\n\n  * **be fruitful and multiply** - See how you translated these commands in Genesis 1:28.\n  * **everything that creeps along the ground** - This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in Genesis 1:25.\n  * **will be blessed in him** - AT: \"will be blessed because of Abraham\" or \"will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham.\" For translating \"in him,\" see how you translated \"through you\" in Genesis 12:3.\n\n\n",

Some reasons for this include:\n\n  1. There are minor differences in the ancient Bible texts.\n  1. A word may have more than one meaning or use.\n  1. It may not be clear what a word (such as a pronoun) refers to in a particular phrase.\n\n### Translation Notes Examples\n\nWhen many scholars say that a word or phrase means one thing, and many others say that it means other things, we show the most common meanings that they give. Our notes for these situations begin with \"Possible meanings are\" and then give a **numbered list**. We recommend that you use the first meaning given. However, if people in your community have access to another Bible that uses one of the other possible meanings, you may decide that it is better to use that meaning.\n>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, \"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.\" (Luke 5:8 ULB)\n\n  * **fell down at Jesus' knees** - <u>Possible</u>  meanings are 1) \"knelt down before Jesus\" or 2) \"bowed down at Jesus feet\" or 3) \"lay down on the ground at Jesus feet.\" Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. Translate it in such a way that the reader could understand either meaning as a possibility.\n  1. If it is not possible to do that in your language, then choose a meaning and translate it with that meaning.\n  1. If not choosing a meaning would make it hard for the readers to understand the passage in general, then choose a meaning and translate it with that meaning.\n\n\n",

In order to do this, he will need to study translation helps prepared by Bible scholars, including translationQuestions. \n\nThe translationQuestions (tQ) are based on the text of the ULB, but they can be used to check any Bible translation. They ask questions about the content of the Bible, which should not change as it is translated into different languages. Along with each question, tQ provides a suggested answer for that question. You can use these sets of questions and answers as a way to check the accuracy of your translation, and you can also use them with members of the language community. \n\nUsing tQ during community checks will help the translator know if the Target Language translation is clearly communicating the right thing. If the community member can correctly answer the questions after hearing the translation of the Bible chapter, then the translation is clear and accurate.\n\n#### Checking Translations with tQ \n\nIn order to use tQ when doing a self-check, follow these steps:\n\n1. Translate a passage, or chapter, of the Bible.\n1. Look at the section called \"Questions.\"\n1. Read the question entry for that passage.\n1. Think of the answer from the translation. Try to not answer from what you know from other Bible translations.\n1. Click on the question to have the answer displayed.\n1. If your answer is correct, you may have done a good translation. But remember, you still need to test the translation with the language community, to see if it communicates that same meaning to others.\n\nIn order to use tQ for a community check, follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the newly completed translation of a Bible chapter to one or more community members. \n2. Tell the listeners to only answer the questions from this translation and to not answer using what they know from other translations of the Bible. This is a test of the translation, not of the people. Because of this, testing the translation with people who do not know the Bible well is very useful.\n1. Look at the section called \"Questions.\"\n1. Read the first question entry for that chapter.\n1. Ask the community members to answer the question. Remind them to think of the answer only from the translation. \n1. Click on the question to have the answer displayed. If the community member's answer is very similar to the answer displayed, then the translation is clearly communicating the right thing. If the person cannot answer the question or answers incorrectly, the translation may not be communicating well and may need to be changed.\n2. Continue with the rest of the questions for the chapter.\n",

Does the UDB help you understand the meaning of the ULB text?\n    * YES? Start translating.\n  * NO? Read the translationNotes for help.\nTranslationNotes are words or phrases copied from the ULB and then explained. In English, every Note that explains the ULB starts the same.

However, on occasion a Note will provide Alternate Translations in addition to the text from the UDB, and sometimes it will quote the text from the UDB as an Alternate Translation. In that case, the Note will say \"(UDB)\" after the text from the UDB.\n\n  * **[Notes that have Alternate Meanings](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/resources_alterm.md)** - Some Notes provide Alternate Meanings when a word or phrase can be understood in more than one way.

In order to do this, he will need to study translation helps prepared by Bible scholars, including the translationWords resource. \n\nIn order to use translationWords, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Identify the important words and any words in the source text that are ambiguous or difficult to understand.\n  1. Look at the section called \"translationWords.\"\n  1. Find the words that you identified as important or difficult, and click on the first one.\n  1. Read the translationWords entry for that word.\n  1. After reading the definition, read the Bible passage again, thinking about the definition that you read in translationWords.\n  1. Think of possible ways to translate the word in your language that fit the Bible context and the definition. It can be helpful to compare words and phrases in your language that have similar meaning and try each one. \n  1. Choose the one that you think is best and write it down.\n  1. Repeat the above steps for other translationWords that you identified. \n  1. When you have thought of a good translation for each of the translationWords, then translate the whole passage.\n  1. Test your translated passage by reading it to others. Change to a different word or phrase in places where others do not understand the meaning.\n\nOnce you have found a good translation for a translationWord, you should use it consistently throughout the translation. If you find a place where that translation does not fit, then think through the process again. It could be that a word with similar meaning will fit better in the new context. Keep track of which word or words you are using to translate each translationWord and make this information available to everyone on the translation team. This will help everyone on the translation team to know which words they should be using.\n\n#### Unknown Ideas\n\nSometimes a translationWord refers to a thing or custom that is unknown in the target language. Possible solutions are to use a descriptive phrase, substitute something similar, use a foreign word from another language, use a more general word or use more specific words. See the lesson on [Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md) for more information.\n\nOne kind of 'unknown idea' are words that refer to Jewish and Christian religious customs and beliefs. Some common unknown ideas are:\n\n**Names of places** such as:\n\n  * Temple (a building where the Israelites offered sacrifices to God)\n  * Synagogue (a building where Jewish people assemble to worship God)\n  * Sacrificial altar (a raised structure on which sacrifices were burned as gifts, or offerings, to God.)\n\n**Titles of people who hold an office** such as:\n\n  * Priest (someone who is chosen to offer sacrifices to God on behalf of his people)\n  * Pharisee (important group of Israel's religious leaders in Jesus' time)\n  * Prophet (person who delivers messages that come directly from God)\n  * Son of Man\n  * Son of God\n  * King (ruler of an independent city, state or country).\n\n**Key Biblical Concepts** such as:\n\n  * Forgiveness (to not resent that person and not be angry at him for doing something hurtful)\n  * Salvation (being saved or rescued from evil, enemies, or from danger)\n  * Redemption (the act of buying back something that was previously owned or that was held captive)\n  * Mercy (helping people who are in need)\n  * Grace (help or regard that is given to someone who has not earned it).\n\n(Notice that all of these are nouns, but they represent events, so they may need to be translated by verb (action) clauses.)\n\nYou may need to discuss the definitions of these translationWords with other members of the translation team or people from your church or village in order to discover the best way to translate them. \n\n",

He must know the kind of animal he is hunting, because a hunter does not shoot birds with the same kind of bullets that he would use to kill an antelope, for example.\n\nIt is the same when we speak to other people. We do not speak to young children with exactly the same words that we would say to an adult. Neither do we speak to our friends in exactly the same way we would speak to the president or ruler of our country.\n\nIn all these cases, we decide to use different words and expressions. For example, if I am sharing the gospel with a young child, I should not say to him, \"Repent, and the Lord will give you his grace.\" Instead, I should say something like, \"Be sorry for the wrong things you have done, and tell Jesus that you are sorry. Then he will welcome you, because he loves you.\"\n\nIn every language, there are words that only adults use, words that children have not yet learned. Of course, the children will eventually learn to use many of these words. But if you say too many of these words to children at the same time, they will find it very difficult to understand you.\n\nIn addition, languages are like trees that grow new leaves and lose old ones: new words are always forming in languages, and some words are always dropping out of use. These words die and drop like leaves; they are words that the old people know but that the younger people never learn to use. After the older generation is gone, these old words will no longer be used in the language. Even if they are written down, in a dictionary for example, as they should be, the younger people will probably not use them again.\n\nFor these reasons, Bible translators must decide who are the people that they will aim their translation at. Here are their choices:\n\n#### Aim to the Future \nTranslators can aim their translation at young mothers and their children who speak the target language, because these people represent the future of their language. If translators work in this way, they will avoid using old words that the younger people are not learning. Instead, they will use ordinary, everyday words as much as possible. In addition, such translators will follow these other rules:\n\n1. They do not try to transliterate common Bible words from other languages into the target language. For example, this means that they will not try to transform the Bible word \"synagogue\" into something like \"sinagog\" and then try to teach its meaning to the people. They will not try to transform the Bible word \"angel\" into something like \"enjel\" and then try to teach its meaning to the target language readers. \n2. They do not try to invent new words to signal ideas that they find in the Bible. For example, if the target language has no word that signals all the aspects included in \"grace\" or \"sanctify,\" translators do not make up new words for them. Instead, they will find phrases suitable for expressing the main part of the word's meaning in the Bible passage that they are working on.\n3. They remember not to take known words in the target language and stuff them with new meaning. They know that if they try this, the people will simply ignore the new meaning. As a result, the people will misunderstand the meaning that you want the text to communicate.\n4. They remember to express the biblical ideas in ways that are clear and natural. (See: [Create Clear Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_clear.md), [Create Natural Translations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/guidelines_natural.md))\n\nWhen translators follow these rules, we call the result a common language version. If you are working to provide a language with its first Bible, then we recommend that you follow these guidelines. Common language versions in English include Today's English Version and The Common English Bible. But remember that your target language will probably want to express many ideas in ways that are very different from what you find in these English versions.\n\n#### Aim for a Bible Study Translation \nTranslators can aim their translation at Christians who want to study the Bible in a way that is deeper than the way it is read by new Christians. Translators may decide to do this if the target language already has a good Bible that speaks well to unbelievers and new believers. If translators work in this way, they may decide to:\n\n1. Try to imitate more of the grammatical structures they find in the biblical languages. For example, when the Bible says, \"The love of God,\" translators might decide to leave the expression ambiguous. If they do this, they will not decide whether it means \"the love that people have for God\" or \"the love that God has for people.\" When the Bible says, \"the love that we have in Christ Jesus,\" translators might decide not to say that it means \"because of Christ Jesus\" or \"united to Christ Jesus.\"\n2. Try to say what Greek or Hebrew words \"stand behind\" various expressions in translation. For example, they can do this with footnotes.\n3. Try to invent new expressions in the target language that signal more of the meaning carried by biblical words. If translators do this, they must become creative with the target language.\n\nWe do not recommend that you follow this second path unless the target language already has a Bible translation that communicates in a clear and natural way.\n",

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n   1. Read the whole passage through before you translate it. Understand the main point of the whole passage before you begin to translate it. If it is a narrative passage, such as a story of one of Jesus' miracles, picture the original situation. Imagine you were there. Imagine how people felt.\n   1. When translating the Bible, always use at least two versions of the Bible together as your source text. Comparing two versions will help you to think about the meaning, so that you do not just follow the words of one version literally. The two versions should be:\n\n      * One version that follows the form of the original language fairly closely, such as the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB).\n      * One meaning-based version, such as the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).\n\n   1. Use the translationWords resources to learn about terms that you are not familiar with. Words sometimes have more than one meaning. Make sure that you have understood the right meaning of the word in the passage.\n   1. Also use the translationNotes that are with the ULB Bible. These are available in the translationStudio program and the Door43 website. These will explain things about the passage that may not be clear. If possible, also use other reference books, such as other versions of the Bible, a Bible dictionary, or Bible commentaries.\n\n\n\n",

Now, we will look at meaning-based translations  These translations are also called: \n\n  * meaning-equivalent\n  * idiomatic\n  * dynamic\n\n### Key Characteristic\n\nThe key characteristic of meaning-based translations is that they give priority to translating the meaning over reproducing the form of the source text. That is, they **change the form of the text as needed in order to make the meaning clear.**  The most common types of changes that meaning-based translations make are:\n\n  * change word order to match the grammar of the target language\n  * replace foreign grammatical structures with natural ones\n  * change order of reasons or results to match the normal order of the flow of logic in the target language\n  * substitute or explain idioms\n  * explain or translate terms from other languages (\"Golgotha\" = \"place of the skull\")\n  * use phrases with simpler words instead of trying to find single word equivalents for difficult or uncommon words in the source text\n  * replace terms that are unknown in the target culture with equivalent terms or descriptions\n  * replace connecting words that the target language does not use with connecting words that the target language needs\n  * substitute target language figures of speech that have the same meaning as the original figures of speech\n  * include implied information that is necessary to understand the meaning of the text\n  * explain unclear phrases or constructions\n\n### Examples of Meaning-Based Translations\n\nWhat does a meaning-based translation look like? We will look at how different versions translate the same verse.\n\nIn Luke 3:8, *John the Baptist rebukes the self-righteous people who came to be baptized.*\n\nThe **Greek**  text of the first half of the verse is shown below.\n\n>Ποιήσατε οὖν καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας\n\nThe **English**  translation in the same order as each Greek word, with some alternative English words to choose from, is below.\n\n>Do/make/produce therefore fruits fit/appropriate of the repentance\n\n#### Literal\n\nA literal translation would usually follow the words and order of the Greek text as closely as possible, such as the following.\n\n>Produce fruits that are worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8 ULB)\n\nNote that this modified-literal translation retains the words \"fruits\" and \"repentance.\" The word order is also very similar to the Greek text. This is because the ULB is designed to show translators what is in the original text. But it may not be the natural or clear way to communicate this meaning in your language.\n\n#### Meaning-Based\n\nMeaning-based translations, on the other hand, are more likely to change the words and order if the translators think it will help to clarify the meaning. Consider these three meaning-based translations:\n\nFrom the Living Bible:\n>…prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds. \n\nFrom the New Living Translation:\n>Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.  \n\nFrom the Unlocked Dynamic Bible\n>Do the things that show that you have truly turned away from your sinful behavior!\n\nNotice that these translations have changed the word order to be more natural in English. Also, the word \"fruits\" no longer appears. In fact, the Living Bible translation uses almost none of the words in the ULB translation. Instead, rather than \"fruits,\" the meaning-based translations refer to \"deeds\" or to \"the way you live.\" \"Fruits\" in this verse is used as part of a metaphor. The meaning of \"fruits\" in this metaphor is \"the things that a person does.\" (See [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md).) \n\nSo these translations translated the meaning in context, rather than just the words. They also used more understandable phrases such as, \"turned from sin\" or \"turned away from your sinful behavior\" rather than the single difficult word, \"repentance,\" or they explained the word by saying, \"repented of your sins and turned to God.\"  The meaning in all of them is the same, but the form is very different. In the meaning-based translations, the meaning is much clearer. \n",

They have the following definitions:\n\n  * **Form** - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. \"Form\" refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.\n  * **Meaning** - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.\n\n### An Example\n\nLet's consider an example from normal life. Suppose a friend sent you the note below:\n\n  * \"I am having a very difficult week. My mother was sick and I spent all of my money to take her to the doctor and to buy medicine for her. I do not have anything left. My employer will not pay me until next weekend. I do not know how I am going to make it through the week. I do not even have money to buy food.\"\n\n#### The Meaning\n\nWhy do you think the friend sent this note? Just to tell you about his week? Probably not. His true intention was more likely to tell you:\n\n  * \"I would like you to give me money.\"\n\nThat is the primary **meaning** of the note that the sender wanted to communicate to you. It is not a report, but a request. However, it would be rude in some cultures to ask for money so directly—even from a friend. Therefore, he adjusted the **form** of the note to fill out the request and help you to understand his need. He wrote in a culturally-acceptable way that presented his need for money but did not obligate you to respond. He explained why he had no money (his sick mother), that his need was only temporary (until he is paid), and that his situation was desperate (no food). In other cultures, a more direct form of request might be more appropriate to communicate this meaning.\n\n#### The Form\n\nIn this example, the **form** is the entire text of the note. The **meaning** is \"I would like you to give me money!\"\n\nWe use these terms in a similar way. **Form** will refer to the entire text of the verses that we are translating. **Meaning** will refer to the idea or ideas that the text is trying to communicate. The best form for communicating a certain meaning will be different in different languages and cultures.\n\n\n",

However, the form of the text is also very important. It is more than just a \"container\" for the meaning. It affects the way the meaning is understood and received. So the form itself also has a meaning.\n\nFor example, look at the differences in form between two translations of Psalm 9:1-2:\n\nFrom the New Life Version:\n>I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart. I will tell of all the great things You have done. I will be glad and full of joy because of You. I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.  \n\nFrom the New Revised Standard Version\n>I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart;\n>>I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.\n>\n>I will be glad and exult in you;\n>>I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.\n\nThe first version puts the text into a form that is no different than the form it uses for telling stories. Each line of the Psalm is stated as a separate sentence.\n\nIn the second version, the text is arranged as lines of poetry are arranged in the target culture, with each line of the poem on a separate line of the page. Also, the first two lines are joined with a semi-colon, with the second line indented. These things indicate that the two lines are related - they say very similar things. The third and fourth lines also have the same arrangement.\n\nA reader of the second version will know that this Psalm is a poem or a song because of the form that it has, while the reader of the first version may not get that understanding, because it was not communicated through the form of the text. The reader of the first version might be confused, because the Psalm seems to be a song, but it is not presented as one. The words are expressing a joyful emotion. As a translator, you should use the form for expressing a joyful song in your language.\n\nLook also at the form of 2 Samuel 18:33b in the New International Version:\n\n>\"O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you–O Absalom, my son, my son!\" \n\nSomeone might say that the meaning contained in this part of the verse is, \"I wish that I had died instead of my son Absalom.\" This does summarize the meaning contained in the words. But the form communicates much more than just that content. The repetition of \"my son\" so many times, the repetition of the name \"Absalom,\" the expression \"O,\" the wish form \"If only…\" all communicate a strong emotion of deep anguish on the part of a father who has lost a son. As a translator, you need to translate not just the meaning of the words, but also the meaning of the form. For 2 Samuel 18:33b, it is important that you use a form that communicates the same emotion as contained in the original language.\n\nSo we need to examine the form of the biblical text and ask ourselves why it has that form and not some other one. What attitude or emotion is it communicating? Other questions that might help us to understand the meaning of the form are: \n\n  * Who wrote it?\n  * Who received it?\n  * In what situation was it written?\n  * Which words and phrases were chosen and why?\n  * Are the words very emotional words, or is there anything special about the order of the words?\n\nWhen we understand the meaning of the form, then we can choose a form that has that same meaning in the target language and culture.\n\n### Culture Affects Meaning\n\nThe meaning of forms is determined by culture. The same form might have different meanings in different cultures. In translation, the meaning must remain the same, including the meaning of the form. This means that the form of the text must change to fit the culture. The form includes the language of the text, its arrangement, any repetitions, or any expressions that imitate sounds like \"O.\" You must examine all of these things, decide what they mean, and then decide which form will express that meaning in the best way for the target language and culture.\n\n",

These levels include: \n\n  * Meaning of words\n  * Meaning of phrases\n  * Meaning of sentences\n  * Meaning of paragraphs\n  * Meaning of chapters\n  * Meaning of books\n\n### Words Have Meaning\n\nWe are used to thinking that the meaning of a text is in the words. But this meaning is controlled by the context that each word is in. That is, the meaning of the individual words is controlled by the levels above it, including the phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. For example, a single word like \"give\" may have the following possible meanings, depending on the context (the higher levels):\n\n  * to grant a gift\n  * to collapse or break\n  * to surrender\n  * to quit\n  * to concede\n  * to supply\n  * etc.\n\n### Building the Larger Meaning\n\nThe translator must determine what each word means in each context, and then reproduce that same meaning in the translated text. That means that words cannot be translated individually, but only with the meaning that they have when they are combined together with the other words in the phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters in which they form a part. That is why the translator must read the whole paragraph, chapter, or book that he is translating before starting to translate it. By reading the larger levels, he will understand how each of the lower levels fits into the whole, and will translate each part so that it communicates the meaning in a way that makes the most sense with the higher levels.  \n\n",

An extreme version of a literal translation would not be a translation at all—it would have the same characters and words as the source language. The next closest step would be to replace each word in the source language with an equivalent word from the target language. Because of differences in grammar between languages, the target language audience would probably not understand this kind of translation. Some translators of the Bible wrongly believe that they should keep the word order of the source text in the target text and only substitute target language words for source language words. They wrongly believe that this shows respect for the source text as God's word. But in fact this kind of translation keeps people from understanding God's word. God wants people to understand his word, so it shows the greatest respect for the Bible and for God to translate the Bible so that people can understand it.\n\n#### Weaknesses of Literal Translation\n\nLiteral translations usually contain the following problems: \n\n  * foreign words that are not understood by the target audience\n  * word order that is strange or awkward in the target language\n  * idioms that are not used or understood in the target language\n  * names of objects that do not exist in the target culture\n  * descriptions of customs that are not understood in the target culture\n  * paragraphs that have no logical connections in the target language\n  * stories and explanations that do not make sense in the target language\n  * implied information is left out that is necessary for understanding the intended meaning\n\n#### When to Translate Literally\n\nThe only time to translate literally is when translating Gateway Language Materials, such as the ULB, that will be used by Other Language translators. The purpose of the ULB is to show the translator what is in the original. Even so, the ULB is not strictly literal. It is a modified literal translation that uses the target language grammar so that readers can understand it (see the lesson [Modified Literal Translation](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_modifyliteral.md)).

Their reasons depend on the kind of document they are translating, and on the needs of the person who has asked them to translate it. In the case of Bible translation, people usually do their work because they want the Bible's ideas to affect the target language readers in the same way that the original readers and hearers of the biblical texts were affected. Because God's ideas in the Bible lead us to eternal life with him through Jesus Christ, translators also want the target language readers to know his ideas.\n\n#### How do we as Bible translators usually expect to represent the biblical ideas? \n\nThere are various ways in which we can represent the ideas in a source text: we can put them into a list, we can summarize them using far less space on the written page, we can simplify them (as we often do in children's Bible story books and in other kinds of Bible helps), or we can even put them into diagrams or charts. However, Bible translators usually try to present the biblical ideas as completely as possible. This also means that they try to produce in translation the same kinds of documents as the original documents (a prophecy for a prophecy, a letter for a letter, a book of history for a book of history, etc.) Also, they try to recreate the same **tensions** in the translation that exist in the source texts.\n\n#### What do we mean by \"tension\" in texts? \n\nExamples of tension occur when a reader wonders what will happen next to the participants in a story, or when a reader follows the argument, encouragement, and warnings of an epistle writer or of a conversation that is reported in the text. A reader can feel tension when reading a psalm, since the praises of God affect the psalmist in various ways. When reading an Old Testament prophetic book, the reader can feel tension rise as the prophet condemns people for their sin, or as he warns them to turn back to God. Tension may also be felt when reading about God's promises for the future, as one considers when God fulfilled those promises, or when he will fulfill them. Good translators study the kinds of tension in the source documents, and they try to recreate those tensions in the target language.\n\nAnother way to talk about recreating the tensions in the source text is to say that the translation should have the same effect on the target audience that the source text had on the original audience. For example, if the source text is a rebuke to the original audience, the target audience should also feel the translation as a rebuke. A translator will need to think about how the target language expresses rebukes and other types communication, so that the translation will have the right kind of effect on the target audience.\n",

All names in the Bible have meaning. Most of the time, names in the Bible are used simply to identify the people and places they refer to.

(Hebrews 7:1 ULB)\n\nHere the writer uses the name \"Melchizedek\" simply to refer to a man who had that name, and the title \"king of Salem\" simply to tell us something about Melchizedek.\n\n>His name \"Melchizedek\" means \"king of righteousness,\" and also \"king of Salem,\" that is, \"king of peace. (Hebrews 7:2 ULB)\n\nHere the writer explains the meanings of Melchizedek's name and title.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n  * Readers may not know some of the names in the Bible. They may not know whether a name refers to a person or place or something else. \n  * Readers may need to understand the meaning of a name in order to understand the passage. \n  * Some names may have different sounds or combinations of sounds that are not used in your language or are unpleasant to say in your language. \n  * Some people and places in the Bible have two names. Readers may not realize that two names refer to the same person or place.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>You went over the <u>Jordan</u> and came to <u>Jericho</u>. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the <u>Amorites</u> (Joshua 24:11 ULB)\n\nReaders might not know that \"Jordan\" is the name of a river, \"Jericho\" is the name of a city, and \"Amorites\" is the name of a group of people.\n\n>she said, \"Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me?\"  Therefore the well was called <u>Beerlahairoi</u>; (Genesis 16:13-14 ULB)\n\nReaders may not understand the second sentence if they do not know that \"Beerlahairoi\" means \"Well of the the  Living One who sees me.\"\n\n>She named him <u>Moses</u> and said, \"Because I drew him from the water.\" (Exodus 2:11 ULB)\n\nReaders may not understand why she said this if they do not know that the name Moses sounds like the Hebrew words \"pull out.\"\n\n><u>Saul</u> was in agreement with his death (Acts 8:1 ULB)<br>\n\n\n<blockquote>It came about in Iconium that <u>Paul</u> and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue (Acts 14:1 ULB) </blockquote>\n\nReaders may not know that the names Saul and Paul refer to the same person.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. If readers cannot easily understand from the context what kind of a thing a name refers to, you can add a word to clarify it.\n  1. If readers need to understand the meaning of a name in order to understand what is said about it, copy the name and tell about its meaning either in the text or in a footnote.\n  1. Or if readers need to understand the meaning of a name in order to understand what is said about it, and that name is used only once, translate the meaning of the name.\n  1. If a person or place has two different names, use one name all of the time and write a footnote when the source text uses the name that is used less frequently.  \n  1. Or use whatever name is given in the source text, and add a footnote that explains who or what the name refers to.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If readers cannot easily understand from the context what kind of a thing a name refers to, you can add a word to clarify it.\n\n  * **You went over the <u>Jordan</u> and came to <u>Jericho</u>. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the <u>Amorites</u>** (Joshua 24:11 ULB) \n      * \"You went over the <u>Jordan River </u> and came to the city of Jericho. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with <u>the tribe of the Amorites</u>\"\n\n  * **Shortly after, some Pharisees came and said to him, \"Go and leave here because <u>Herod</u> wants to kill you.\"** (Luke 13:31 ULB) \n      * \"Shortly after, some Pharisees came and said to him, \"Go and leave here because <u>King Herod</u> wants to kill you.\" \n\n2. If readers need to understand the meaning of a name in order to understand what is said about it, copy the name and tell about its meaning either in the text or in a footnote.\n\n  * **She named him <u>Moses</u> and said, \"Because I drew him from the water.\"** (Exodus 2:11 ULB)\n      * \"She named him <u>Moses, which sounds like 'drawn out,'</u> and said, \"Because I drew him from the water.\" \n\n3.  Or if readers need to understand the meaning of a name in order to understand what is said about it, and that name is used only once, translate the meaning of the name.\n\n  * **she said, \"Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me?\"  Therefore the well was called <u>Beerlahairoi</u>;** (Genesis 16:13-14 ULB) \n      * \"she said, \"Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me?\"  Therefore the well was called <u>Well of the One who sees me</u>; \"\n\n4. If a person or place has two different names, use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name. Write a footnote when the source text uses the name that is used less frequently.  For example, Paul is called \"Saul\" before Acts 13 and \"Paul\" after Acts 13. You could translate his name as \"Paul\" all of the time, except in Acts 13:9 where it talks about him having both names. \n\n  * **a young man named <u>Saul</u>** (Acts 7:58 ULB) \n      * \"a young man named <u>Paul</u>\"<sup>1</sup>  The footnote would look like:\n          * <sup>[1]</sup>Most versions say Saul here, but most of the time in the Bible he is called Paul.\n\n  * **But <u>Saul</u>, who is also called <u>Paul</u>, was filled with the Holy Spirit;** (Acts 13:9)\n      * \"But <u>Saul</u>, who is also called <u>Paul</u>, was filled with the Holy Spirit;\"\n\n5. Or if a person or place has two names, use whatever name is given in the source text, and add a footnote that explains who or what the name refers to. For example, you could write \"Saul\" where the source text has \"Saul\" and \"Paul\" where the source text has \"Paul.\" \n\n  * **a young man named <u>Saul</u>** (Acts 7:58 ULB) \n      * \"a young man named <u>Saul</u>\" \n\n  * **But <u>Saul</u>, who is also called <u>Paul</u>, was filled with the Holy Spirit;** (Acts 13:9)\n      * \"But <u>Saul</u>, who is also called <u>Paul</u>, was filled with the Holy Spirit;\"\n\n  * **It came about in Iconium that <u>Paul</u> and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue** (Acts 14:1 ULB)\n      * \"It came about in Iconium that <u>Paul</u><sup>1</sup> and Barnabas entered together into the synagogue\" (Acts 14:1 ULB) The footnote would look like:\n          * <sup>[1]</sup>This is the man that was called Saul before Acts 13.\n\n\n",

Some translators might want to do this because, as we saw in the teaching module \"The Importance of Form,\" the form of a text affects the meaning of the text. However, we must keep in mind that people from different cultures understand the meaning of forms differently. In different cultures, the same form may be understood in very different ways. Therefore it is not possible to protect the meaning from change by keeping the original forms. The only way to protect the meaning is to change the original form to a new form that communicates the same meaning in the new culture as the old form did in the old culture.\n\n### Different languages use different orders of words and phrases\n\nIf you keep the source word order in  your translation, it will be very difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the people who speak your language to understand it. You must use the natural word order of the target language so that people can understand the meaning of the text.\n\n### Different languages use different idioms and expressions\n\nEach language has its own idioms and other expressions, such as words that represent sounds or emotions. In order to express the meaning of these things, you must choose an idiom or expression that has that same meaning in the target language, not just translate each word. If you just translate each word, the idiom or expression will have the wrong meaning.\n\n### Some terms do not have equivalents in other cultures\n\nThe Bible contains many terms for things that no longer exist, such as ancient weights (stadia, cubit), money (denarius, stater) and measures (hin, ephah). Animals in Scripture may not exist in some parts of the world (fox, camel). Other words may be unknown in some cultures (snow, circumcision). It is not possible to simply substitute equivalent words for these terms in those situations. The translator must find another way to communicate the original meaning.\n\n### The Bible was intended to be understood\n\nThe testimony of the Scriptures themselves shows that they were meant to be understood. The Bible is written in three languages because the language that God's people used was different in different times. When the Jews returned from exile and no longer remembered Hebrew, the priests translated the Old Testament readings into Aramaic so they could understand (Neh 8:8). Later, when the New Testament was written, it was written in the common Koine Greek, which was the language that most people spoke at that time, rather than Hebrew or Aramaic or even classical Greek, which would have been harder for common people to understand.\n\nThese and other reasons demonstrate that God wants people to understand his word. So we know that he wants us to translate the meaning of the Bible, not reproduce the form. The meaning of the Scriptures is more important than the form.\n\n",

The purpose of these steps is to help the translator produce a translation that is natural, understandable, and accurate. One of the most common translator mistakes is failing to use the natural forms in the target language for developing a coherent text. By following these steps, the translator will produce a more natural and more understandable translation.\n\n  1. Read the entire chosen passage in the source language. The passage could be a paragraph or one thing that happened in a story, or even a whole section (in some Bibles, everything from one heading to the next heading). In a difficult text, a passage might be only one or two verses. \n  1. Without looking at the text in the source language, verbally tell it in the target language. Although you might forget some parts, continue telling what you remember right to the end.\n  1. Again, look at the source language text. Now tell everything again in the target language. \n  1. Looking again at the source language text, focus only on the parts you forgot, and then re-tell it all in the target language by memory.\n  1. After remembering the entire passage, write it exactly as it you re-told it by memory.\n  1. Once written, look at the source language to see if you have overlooked some detail. Insert any such detail in the most natural place.\n  1. If you do not understand something in the source text, write into the translation '[not understood]' and continue writing the rest of the passage.\n  1. Now, read what you wrote. Assess whether you understand it or not. Fix the parts that should be improved.\n  1. Go on to the next section. Read it in the source language. Strictly follow steps 2 through 8.\n\n\n",

First, if you translate from a copyrighted work without prior permission you are breaking the law because translation is a right reserved for the owner of the content. In some places, copyright infringement is a criminal offense and may be prosecuted by the government without the copyright holder's consent! Second, when a translation is done off of a copyrighted work, the translation is the intellectual property of the copyright holder of the source text.

It is important because translations (and source texts) can change frequently. Being able to identify each version helps bring clarity about which iteration is being talked about. Version numbers are also important because all translations should be based off of the latest source text. If the source text changes, the translation should eventually be updated to match the latest version. \n\nBefore starting a translation project, please ensure that you have the latest version of the source text.\n\n### How Versioning Works\n\nVersion numbers are only given when a work is released, not when they are edited. Revision history is kept in Door43, but this is different than a work being given a version number.\n\n![](http://cdn.door43.org/ta/jpg/versioning.jpg)\n\nEach source text is given a whole number for each release (version 1, 2, 3, etc).  Any translations based on that source text will take the version number of the source text and add .1 (a translation from English OBS version 4 would become version 4.1).  Any further translation based on the intermediate translation would add another .1 to the version number it was created from (for example 4.1.1).  New releases of any of these texts increment their \"decimal place\" by 1.\n\nPlease see http://ufw.io/versioning for more details.\n\n### Where to Find the Latest Version\n\nhttps://unfoldingword.org always has the latest published version of each resource.

The translator will need to understand these terms in order to use the Translation Manual.*\n\n**Term** - A word or phrase that refers to one thing, idea, or action. For example, the term in English for pouring liquid into one's mouth is \"drink.\" The term for a ceremony that marks an important transition in someone's life is \"rite of passage.\" The difference between a term and a word is that a term can contain several words.\n\n**Text** - A text is something that a speaker or writer is communicating to a hearer or reader by means of language. The speaker or writer has a certain meaning in mind, and so he or she chooses a form of the language to express that meaning.\n\n**Context** - The words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs surrounding the word, phrase, or sentence in question. The context is the text that surrounds the part of the text that you are examining. The meaning of individual words and phrases can change when they are in different contexts.\n\n**Form** - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. \"Form\" refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.\n\n**Grammar** - The way that sentences are put together in a language. This has to do with the order of its various parts, such as if the verb goes first or last or in the middle. \n\n**Noun** - A kind of word that refers to a person, place, or thing. A proper noun is the name of a person or place. An abstract noun is a thing that we cannot see or touch, like \"peace\" or \"unity.\" It refers to an idea or a state of being. Some languages do not use abstract nouns.\n\n**Verb** - A kind of word that refers to an action, like \"walk\" or \"arrive.\"\n\n**Modifier** - A kind of word that says something about another word. Both adjectives and adverbs are modifiers.\n\n**Adjective** - A kind of word that says something about a noun. For example, the word \"tall\" says something about the noun \"man\" in the following sentence. *I see a tall man*.\n\n**Adverb** - A kind of word that says something about a verb. For example, the word \"loudly\" says something about the verb \"spoke\" in the following sentence. *The man spoke loudly to the crowd of people*.\n\n**Idiom** - An expression that uses several words and that means something different as a whole than it would if the words were understood with the meanings that they have when they are used separately. Idioms cannot be translated literally, that is, with the meanings of the separate words. For example, \"He kicked the bucket\" is an idiom in English that means, \"He died.\" \n\n**Meaning** - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.\n\n**Translation** - The process of expressing in the form of a target language the same meaning that a writer or speaker expressed in the form of a source language.\n\n**Source Language** - The language *from* which the translation is being made.\n\n**Source Text**- The text *from* which the translation is being made.\n\n**Target Language** - The language *into* which a translation is being made.\n\n**Target Text**- The text being made by the translator as he or she translates the meaning from the source text.\n\n**Original Language** - The language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.\n\n**Language of Wider Communication** - A language that is spoken over a broad area and by many people. For most people, this is not their first language, but is the language that they use to speak to people outside of their language community. Some people call this a trade language. Most Bibles will be translated using a language of wider communication as the source language.\n\n**Literal Translation** - A translation that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes as a result.\n\n**Meaning-based Translation (or Dynamic Translation)** - A translation that focuses on reproducing the meaning of the source text in the target text, even if the form changes as a result.\n\n**Passage** - A section of the Bible text that is being talked about. This can be as small as one verse, but it is usually several verses that together have one topic or tell one story. \n\n**Gateway Language** - A Gateway Language (GL) is a language of wider communication that we have identified as being one of the languages into which we will translate all of our translation tools. The set of Gateway Languages is the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language of the world, through translation by bilingual speakers.  \n\n**Other Language** - The Other Languages (OLs) are all of the languages of the world that are not Gateway Languages. We translate our Bible translation tools into the Gateway Languages so that people can use those tools to translate the Bible into the Other Languages.\n\n**End-user Bible** - This is a Bible that people have translated so that it speaks in a natural way in the target language. It is meant to be used in churches and homes. In contrast, the ULB and UDB are Bibles that are translation tools. They do not speak naturally in any language, because the ULB is a literal translation and the UDB avoids using idioms and figures of speech, which a natural translation would use. Using these translation tools, a translator can produce an end-user Bible.\n\n**Participant** - A participant is one of the actors in a sentence. This could be the person doing the action, or the person that is receiving the action, or mentioned as participating in some way. A participant could even be an object that is stated as participating in the action of the sentence. For example, in the following sentence, the participants are underlined: <u>John</u> and <u>Mary</u> sent <u>a letter</u> to <u>Andrew</u>. Sometimes participants are left unstated, but they are still part of the action. In this case, the participant is *implied*. For example, in the following sentence, there are only two participants stated: <u>Andrew</u> received <u>a letter</u>. The senders, John and Mary, are implied. In some languages, the implied participants must be stated.\n\n",

These original writers used the language that their people spoke so that they and their people could understand God's messages. God wants people today to understand those same messages. But people today do not speak those languages that the Bible was written in long ago. So God has given us the task of translating the Bible into the languages that people speak today. \n\nThe particular language that people use to communicate God's messages is not important. The specific words that are used are not important. What is important is the meaning that those words communicate. The meaning is the message, not the words or the language. What we must translate, then, is not the words or the forms of the sentences of the source languages, but the meaning.\n\nLook at the pairs of sentences below. \n\n  * It rained all night. / Rain fell all night.\n\n  * John was very surprised when he heard the news. / The news very much amazed John when he heard it.\n\n  * It was a hot day. / The day was hot.\n\n  * Peter's house / The house that belongs to Peter\n\nYou can see that the meaning of each pair of sentences is the same, even though they use different words. This is the way it is in a good translation. We will use different words than the source text, but we will keep the meaning the same. We will use words that our people understand and use them in a way that is natural for our language. Communicating the same meaning as the source text in a clear and natural way is the goal of translation.\n",

It also talks about people and places that you may not have names for. \n\nWhen that happens you  can \"borrow\" the word from the Bible into your own language. This means that you basically copy it from the other language.  This page tells how to \"borrow\" words.  (There are also other ways to translate words for things that are not in your language. See [Translate Unknowns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_unknown.md)).\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>He saw a <u>fig</u> tree on the roadside  (Matthew 21:19 ULB) \n\nIf there are no fig trees where your language is spoken, you might not already have a name for this kind of tree.\n\n>Above him were the <u>seraphs</u> each one had six wings; with two each covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.  (Isaiah 6:2 ULB)\n\nYour language might not already have a name for this kind of creature.\n\n>The declaration of the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of <u>Malachi</u>.  (Malachi 1:1 ULB)\n\nMalachi might not be a name that people who speak your language use. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nThere are several things to be aware of when borrowing words from another language.\n\n  * Different languages use different scripts, such as the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Devanagari, and Korean scripts. These scripts use different shapes to represent the letters in their alphabets. \n  * Languages that use the same script might pronounce the letters in that script differently. For example, when speaking German, people pronounce the letter \"j\" the same way that people pronounce the letter \"y\" when speaking English. \n  * Languages do not all have the same sounds or combinations of sounds. For example, many languages do not have the soft \"th\" sound in the English word \"think\" and some languages cannot start a word with a combination of sounds like \"st\" as in \"stop.\" \n\nThere are several ways to borrow a word. \n\n  1. If your language uses a different script from the language you are translating from, you can simply substitute each letter shape with the corresponding letter shape of the script of your language.\n  1. You can spell the word as the other language spells it, and pronounce it the way your language normally pronounces those letters.   \n  1. You can pronounce the word similarly to the way the other language does, and adjust the spelling to fit the rules of your language.  \n\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If your language uses a different script from the language you are translating from, you can simply substitute each letter shape with the corresponding letter shape of the script of your language.\n  * **צְפַנְיָ֤ה** - A man's name in Hebrew letters.\n      * \"Zephaniah\" - The same name in Roman letters\n\n2. You can spell the word as the other language spells it, and pronounce it the way your language normally pronounces those letters.\n  * **Zephaniah**  - This is a man's name.\n      * \"Zephaniah\" - The name as it is spelled in English, but you can pronounce it according to the rules of your language.\n\n3. You can pronounce the word similarly to the way the other language does, and adjust the spelling to fit the rules of your language.\n  * **Zephaniah**  - If your language does not have the \"z\", you could use \"s\". If your writing system does not use \"ph\" you could use \"f\". Depending on how you pronounce the \"i\" you could spell it with \"i\" or \"ai\" or \"ay\".\n      * \"Sefania\"\n      * \"Sefanaia\"\n      * \"Sefanaya\"\n\n\n",

The translationWords pages and the translationNotes will help you understand what they are. After you understand them, you will need to find ways to refer to those things so that people who read your translation will understand what they are.\n>We have here only five loaves of <u>bread</u> and two fish (Matthew 14:17 ULB)\n\nBread is a particular food made by mixing finely crushed grains with oil, and then cooking the mixture so that it is dry. (Grains are the seeds of a kind of grass.) In some cultures people do not have bread or know what it is. \n\n**Reason this is a translation issue**\n\n  * Readers may not know some of the things that are in the Bible because those things are not part of their own culture. \n  * Readers may have difficulty understanding a text if they do not know some of the things that are mentioned in it.\n\n#### Translation Principles\n\n  * Use words that are already part of your language if possible.\n  * Keep expressions short if possible.\n  * Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for <u>jackals</u> (Jeremiah 9:11 ULB)\n\nJackals are wild animals like dogs that live in only a few parts of the world.  So they are not known in many places.\n>Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep's clothing, but are truly ravenous <u>wolves</u>. (Matthew 7:15 ULB)\n\nIf wolves do not live where the translation will be read, the readers may not understand that they are fierce, wild animals like dogs that attack and eat sheep.\n>Then they tried to give Jesus wine that was mixed with <u>myrrh</u>.

Use a phrase that describes the part of the meaning that is important in the particular verse being translated.\n  1. Substitute something similar from your language if doing so does not falsely represent a historical fact.\n  1. Copy the word from another language, and add a general word or descriptive phrase to help people understand it.\n  1. Use a word that is more general in meaning.\n  1. Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning. \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1.

Substitute something similar from your language if doing so does not falsely represent a historical fact. \n\n\n  * **your sins ... will be white like <u>snow</u>** (Isaiah 1:18 ULB) This verse is not about snow. It uses snow in a figure of speech to help people understand how white something will be.\n      * \"your sins ... will be white like <u>milk</u>\"\n      * \"your sins ... will be white like <u>the moon</u>\"\n\n3.

It is not the best choice for doing good translations. A word-for-word translation simply substitutes an equivalent word in the target language for each word in the source language. \n\n#### In word-for-word translations\n\n  * The focus is on one word at a time. \n  * The natural sentence structure, phrase structures and figures of speech of the target language are ignored. \n  * The process of word-for-word translation is very simple.\n    * The first word in the source text is translated by an equivalent word. \n    * Then the next word is done. This continues until the verse is translated. \n  * The word-for-word approach is attractive because it is so simple. However, it results in a poor quality translation.\n\nWord-for-word substitution results in translations that are awkward to read. They are often confusing and give the wrong meaning or even no meaning at all. You should avoid doing this type of translation. Here are some examples:\n\n#### Word Order\n\nHere is an example of Luke 3:16 in the ULB: \n\n>John answered by saying to them all, \"As for me, I baptize you with water, but someone is coming who is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\"\n\nThat translation is clear and easy to understand. But suppose the translators had used the word-for-word method. What would the translation be like?\n\nHere, translated in English, are the words in the same order as the original Greek.\n\n>answered  saying  to all  the  John  I  indeed  with water  baptize  you  he comes  but  who mightier than I of whom not I am worthy untie the strap of the sandals of him he you will baptize with spirit holy and fire\n\nThis translation is awkward and does not make sense in English.\n\nLook at the ULB version above again. The English ULB translators did not keep the original Greek word order. They moved words around in the sentence to fit the rules of English grammar. They also changed some of the phrasing. For example, the English ULB says, \"John answered by saying to them all,\" rather than \"John answered to all saying.\" They used different words in a different order to make the text sound natural so that it could successfully communicate the original meaning.\n\nThe translation must communicate the same meaning as the Greek text. In this example, the ULB is a much better English translation than the awkward word-for-word version.\n\n#### Range of Word Meanings\n\nIn addition, word-for-word substitution usually does not take into account that most words in all languages have a range of meanings. In any one passage, usually the writer had only one of those meanings in mind. In a different passage, he may have had a different meaning in mind. But in word-for-word translations, usually only one meaning is chosen and used throughout the translation.\n\nFor example, the Greek word *aggelos* can refer to a human messenger or to an angel. \n>\"This is he of whom it is written, 'See, I am sending my <u>messenger</u> before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.' (Luke 7:27)\n\nHere the word *aggelos* refers to a human messenger. Jesus was talking about John the Baptist.\n>the <u>angels</u> had gone away from them into heaven  (Luke 2:15)\n\nHere the word *aggelos* refers to angels from heaven.\n\nA word-for-word translation process might use the same word in both verses, even though it is used to refer to two different kinds of beings.  This would be confusing to the reader.\n\n#### Figures of Speech\n\nFinally, figures of speech are not conveyed correctly in a word-for-word translation. Figures of speech have meanings that are different from the individual words that they are made up of. When they are translated word-for-word, the meaning of the figure of speech is lost. Even if they are translated so that they follow the normal word order of the target language, readers will not understand their meaning. See the [Figures of Speech](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_intro.md) page to learn how to correctly translate them.\n",

They also use phrases that have similar structures to the phrases in the source language. This kind of translation allows the reader to see the structure of the source text, but it can make it difficult or impossible for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text.  \n  * Dynamic, meaning-based translations focus on representing the meaning of the source language sentence in its context, and will use whatever words and phrase structures are most appropriate to convey that meaning in the target language. The goal of this kind of translation is to make it easy for the reader to understand the meaning of the source text. This is the kind of translation recommended in this Translation Manual for Other Language (OL) translations.\n\nThe ULB is designed to be a literal translation, so that the OL translator can see the forms of the original biblical languages. The UDB is designed to be a dynamic translation, so that the OL translator can understand the meaning of these forms in the Bible. When translating these resources, please translate the ULB in a literal way and translate the UDB in a dynamic way. For more information about these resources, see the Gateway Manual.\n\n\n",

Used by Permission.'\n---\n### What Should I Translate First?\n\nAt some point, the translation team will have to figure out what they should translate first, or, if they have already done some translation, what they should translate next. There are several factors that need to be considered: \n\n  * What does the church want to be translated? \n  * How experienced is the translation team? \n  * How much Biblical content has been translated into this language?\n\nThe answers to these questions are all important. But remember this:\n\n**Translation is a skill that grows with experience.**\n\nBecause translation is a skill that grows, it is wise to start translating content that is less complicated so that the translators can learn the skill while translating something simple. \n\n### Translation Difficulty\n\nWycliffe Bible Translators have rated the difficulty of translating the different books of the Bible. In their rating system, the most complicated books to translate receive a level 5 difficulty. The easiest books to translate are a level 1. \n\nIn general, books that have more abstract, poetic, and theologically loaded terms and ideas are more difficult to translate. Books that are more narrative and concrete are generally easier to translate.\n\n#### Difficulty Level 5 (Most Difficult to Translate)\n\n  * Old Testament\n    * Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel\n  * New Testament\n    * Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews\n\n#### Difficulty Level 4\n\n  * Old Testament\n    * Leviticus, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Lamentations, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephanaiah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi\n  * New Testament\n    * John, 1-2 Corinthians, 1-2 Thessalonians, 1-2 Peter, 1 John, Jude\n\n#### Difficulty Level 3\n\n  * Old Testament\n    * Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy\n  * New Testament\n    * Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, 1-2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, James, 2-3 John, Revelation\n\n#### Difficulty Level 2\n\n  * Old Testament\n    * Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings, 1-2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Jonah\n  * New Testament\n    * *none*\n\n#### Difficulty Level 1 (Easiest to Translate)\n\n  * *none*\n\n### Open Bible Stories\n\nThough Open Bible Stories was not assessed according to this rating system, it should fall under Difficulty Level 1. We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. There are many good reasons to start by translating Open Bible Stories:\n\n  * Open Bible Stories was designed to be easily translated\n    * It is largely narrative\n    * Many difficult phrases and words have been simplified\n    * It has many pictures to help the translator understand the text\n  * Open Bible Stories is much shorter than the Bible or even the New Testament, so it can be quickly completed and distributed to the Church\n  * Since it is not Scripture, Open Bible Stories removes the fear that many translators have of translating the Word of God\n  * Translating Open Bible Stories before translating the Bible gives the translators experience and training in translation, so that when they translate the \n  Bible, they will do it well. By translating Open Bible Stories, the translation team will gain:\n    * Experience in creating a translation and checking team\n    * Experience in doing the translation and checking process\n    * Experience in using the Door43 translation tools\n    * Experience in resolving translation conflicts\n    * Experience in getting church and community participation\n    * Experience in publishing and distributing content\n  * Open Bible Stories is a great tool to teach the church, evangelize the lost, and train the translators in what the Bible is all about\n\nYou can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found that Story #31 (see http://ufw.io/en-obs-31) is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, the church needs to decide what they want to translate, and in what order. But because translation is a skill that improves with use, and because the translation and checking teams can learn so much about translating the Bible by translating Open Bible Stories, and because of the immense value that the translated Open Bible Stories gives to the local church, we highly recommend starting your translation project with Open Bible Stories. \n\nAfter translating Open Bible Stories, the church will need to decide if it would be more beneficial to start with how everything began (Genesis, Exodus) or with Jesus (New Testament gospels). In either case, we recommend starting Bible translation with some of the Difficulty Level 2 and 3 books (like Genesis, Ruth, and Mark). Finally, after the translation team has a lot of experience, then they can start translating Difficulty Level 4 and 5 books (like John, Hebrews, and Psalms). If the translation team follows this schedule, they will make better translations with far fewer mistakes.\n",

For example, \"What is its <u>weight</u>?\" could be expressed as \"How much does it <u>weigh</u>?\" or \"How <u>heavy</u> is it?\"\n\n### Description\n\nRemember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. **Abstract Nouns** are nouns that refer to attitudes, qualities, events, situations, or even to relationships among these ideas. These are things that cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense, such as joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, truth, freedom, vengeance, slowness, length, and weight.\n\nAbstract nouns allow us to express thoughts about ideas in fewer words than if we did not have those nouns. For example, we can say, \"I believe in the forgiveness of sin.\" But if English did not have the two abstract nouns \"forgiveness\" and \"sin,\" then we would have to make a longer sentence to express the same meaning. We would have to say, for example, \"I believe that God is willing to forgive people after they have sinned.\"\n\nAbstract nouns also allow us to refer to a situation without telling more details about it than we want to tell. For example, we can say \"I got here late because there was an accident on the highway.\" \"Accident\" is an abstract noun. If it does not matter whose accident it was, or what kind of accident it was, then it can be better if I do not have to say these things about it.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue: \n\nThe Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use phrases to express those ideas. Those phrases will have other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs, that express some of the meaning in the abstract noun.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>from <u>childhood</u> you have known the sacred writings (2 Timothy 3:15 ULB) \n\nThe abstract noun \"childhood\" refers to when someone is a child.\n>But <u>godliness</u> with <u>contentment</u> is great <u>gain</u>. (1 Timothy 6:6 ULB) \n\nThe abstract nouns \"godliness\" and \"contentment\" refer to being godly and content.\nThe abstract noun \"gain\" refers to something that benefits or helps someone.\n>Today <u>salvation</u> has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. (Luke 19:9 ULB) \n\nThe abstract noun \"salvation\" here refers to being saved.\n>The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider <u>slowness</u> to be (2 Peter 3:9 ULB) \n\nThe abstract noun \"slowness\" refers how slowly something is done.\n>He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the <u>purposes</u> of the heart. (1 Corinthians 4:5 ULB) \n\nThe abstract noun \"purposes\" refers to the things that people want to do and the reasons they want to do them.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf an abstract noun would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here is another option:\n\n  1. Reword the sentence with a phrase that expresses the meaning of the abstract noun. \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Reword the sentence with a phrase that expresses the meaning of the abstract noun.\n\n  * **from <u>childhood</u>  you have known the sacred writings**  (2 Timothy 3:15 ULB)\n      * \"Ever since <u>you were a child</u>  you have known the sacred writings.\"\n\n  * **But <u>godliness with contentment</u>  is great <u>gain</u>.**  (1 Timothy 6:6 ULB)\n      * \"But <u>being godly</u> and <u>content</u>  is very <u>beneficial</u>.\"\n      * \"But we <u>benefit</u>  greatly when we <u>are godly</u> and <u>content</u>.\"\n      * \"But we <u>benefit</u> greatly when we <u>honor and obey God</u> and when we are <u>happy with what we have</u>.\n\n  * **Today <u>salvation</u>  has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.**  (Luke 19:9 ULB)\n      * \"Today the people in this house <u>have been saved</u>…\"\n      * \"Today God <u>has saved</u>  the people in this house…\"\n\n  * **The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider <u>slowness</u>  to be**  (2 Peter 3:9 ULB)\n      * \"The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider <u>moving slowly</u>  to be\"\n\n  * **He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the <u>purposes</u>  of the heart.**  (1 Corinthians 4:5 ULB)\n      * \"He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal <u>the things that people want to do and the reasons they want to do them</u>.\"\n\n",

In active sentences, the subject does the action. In passive sentences the subject is the one that the action is done to. Here are some examples with their subjects underlined:\n\n  * ACTIVE: <u>My father</u> built the house in 2010. \n  * PASSIVE: <u>The house</u>  was built in 2010. \n\nTranslators whose languages do not have passive sentences will need to know how they can translate passive sentences that they find in the Bible. Other translators will need to decide when to use a passive sentence and when not to.\n\n### Description\n\nSome languages have both active and passive forms of sentences.\n\n  * In the **ACTIVE** form, the subject does the action and is always mentioned.\n  * In the **PASSIVE** form, the action is done to the subject and the one who does the action is *not always*  mentioned.\n\nIn the examples of active and passive sentences below, we have underlined the subject.\n\n* **ACTIVE**: <u>My father</u>  built the house in 2010.\n* **PASSIVE**: <u>The house</u>  was built by my father in 2010.\n* **PASSIVE**: <u>The house</u>  was built in 2010. (This does not tell who did the action.)\n\nAll languages have active forms. Some languages have passive forms, and some do not. \nThe passive form is not used for the same reasons in all of the languages that have it.\n\n#### Purposes for the passive:\n\n  * The speaker is talking about the person or thing the action was done to, not about the person who did the action.\n  * The speaker does not want to tell who did the action. \n  * The speaker does not know who did the action.\n\n#### Translation Principles Regarding the Passive\n\n  * Translators whose language does not use passive forms will need to find another way to express the idea. \n  * Translators whose language has passive forms will need to understand why the passive is used in a particular sentence in the Bible and decide whether or not to use a passive form for that purpose in his translation of the sentence.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>And their shooters shot at your soldiers from off the wall, and some of the king's servants <u>were killed</u>, and your servant Uriah the Hittite <u>was killed</u> too. (2 Samuel 11:24 ULB) \n\nThis means that the enemies shooters shot and killed some of the king's servants, including Uriah. The point is what happened to the king's servants and Uriah, not who shot them.\n\n>In the morning when the men of the town got up, the altar of Baal <u>was broken down</u> … (Judges 6:28 ULB) \n\nThe men of the town saw what had happened to the altar of Baal, but they did not know who broke it down. \n\n>No stonework <u>was seen</u> there. (1 Kings 6:18 ULB) \n\nThis means that no one saw stonework there. The point is that no stonework was done there.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf you decide that it is better to translate without a passive form, here are some strategies you might consider.\n\n  1. Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who or what did the action.\n  1. Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who or what did the action.\n  1. Use a different verb.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1.

Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who did the action. Instead use a generic expression like \"they,\" or \"people,\" or \"someone.\" \n  * **It would be better for him if a millstone <u>were put</u>  around his neck and he <u>were thrown</u>  into the sea**  (Luke 17:2 ULB)\n      * It would be better for him if <u>they were to put</u>  a millstone around his neck and <u>throw</u>  him into the sea.\n      * It would be better for him if <u>someone were to put</u>  a heavy stone around his neck and <u>throw</u>  him into the sea.\n\n3.

Sometimes they are used in the Bible for other functions.\n\n**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use a statement for some of the functions that statements are used for in the Bible.\n\n#### Examples from the Bible\n\nStatements are normally used to give **information**. All of the sentences in John 1:6-8 below are statements, and their function is to give information.\n\n> There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light, that all might believe through him. John was not the light, but came that he might testify about the light. (John 1:6-8 ULB)\n\nA statement can also be used as a **command** to tell someone what to do.

(Matthew 1:21 ULB)\n\nA statement can also be used to make a **request**. The man with leprosy was not just saying what Jesus was able to do. He was asking Jesus to heal him.\n>Behold, a leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, \"Lord, if you are willing, _you can make me clean_.\" (Matthew 8:2 ULB)\n\nA statement can also be used to **perform** something. By telling Adam that the ground was cursed because of him, God actually cursed it. \n>cursed is the ground because of you; (Genesis 3:17 ULB)\n\nBy telling a man that his sins were forgiven, Jesus forgave the man's sins.\n>Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, \"Son, _your sins are forgiven_.\"  (Luke 2:5 ULB)\n\n####  Translation Strategies \n1.

When people who speak these languages hear a phrase with a noun, they assume that its function is to distinguish one item from another.\n\n### Description\n\nIn some languages, phrases can be used with a noun for two different things. They can either distinguish one item from other possible items, or they can give more information about an item. That information could be new to the reader, or a reminder about something the reader might already know or assume.\n\n  * \"Mary gave some of the food to <u>her sister who was very thankful</u>. \n      * If her sister was usually thankful, the phrase \"who was thankful\" could distinguish this sister of Mary's from another sister who was not usually thankful.  \n\n  * \"Mary gave some of the food to her <u>sister, who was very thankful</u>.\" \n      * This same phrase can be used to inform us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish one sister from another. \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * Some languages use phrases with a noun only for distinguishing on item from another. When translating a phrase that is used for giving more information, people who speak these languages will need to separate the phrase from the noun. Otherwise people who read it or hear it will think that  the phrase is meant to distinguish one item from other possible items.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n**Examples of words and phrases that are used to distinguish one item from other possible items**: These usually do not cause a problem in translation.\n\n>… The curtain is to separate <u>the holy place</u> from <u>the most holy place</u>. (Exodus 26:33 ULB) \n\nThe words \"holy\" and \"most holy\" distinguish two different places from each other and from any other place.\n\n>A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to <u>the woman who bore him</u>. (Proverbs 17:25 ULB)\n\nThe phrase \"who bore him\" distinguishes which woman the son is bitterness to. He is not bitterness to all women, but to his mother.\n\n**Examples of words and phrases that are used to give added information or a reminder about an item**: These are a translation issue for languages that do not use these.

(Psalm 119:39 ULB)\n\nThe word \"righteous\" simply reminds us that God's judgments are righteous. It does not distinguish his righteous judgement from his unrighteous judgement, because all of his judgments are righteous.\n\n>Can <u>Sarah, who is ninety years old,</u> bear a son? - (Genesis 17:17-18 ULB) \n\nThe phrase \"who is ninety years old\" is the reason that Abraham did not think that Sarah could bear a son. He was not distinguishing one woman named Sarah from another woman named Sarah, and he was not telling anyone something new about her age. He simply did not think that a  woman who was that old could bear a child.  \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf your language uses words or phrases with a noun only to distinguish one item from another, \nsee [Phrases that Inform or Remind](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_informremind.md) for translation strategies. \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\nSee [Phrases that Inform or Remind](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_informremind.md) for how to translate phrases that inform or remind.\n\n\n\n\n",

In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end. The mark shows that it is an exclamation. The situation and the meaning of what the people say helps us understand what feelings they were expressing. In the example below from Matthew 8, the speakers were terribly afraid. In the example from Matthew 9, the speakers were amazed, because something happened that they had never seen before.\n\n>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)\n\n\n>When the demon had been driven out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were astonished and said, \"This has never been seen before in Israel!\"  (Matthew 9:33 ULB)\n\n**Reason this is a translation issue**: Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence shows strong emotion.\n\n#### Examples from the Bible \n\nSome exclamations have a word that shows feeling. The sentences below have \"Oh\" and \"Ah.\" The word \"oh\" here shows the speaker's amazement. \n\n><u>Oh</u>, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)\n\nThe word \"Ah\" below shows that Gideon was very frightened. \n>Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, \"<u>Ah</u>, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!\" (Judges 6:22 ULB)\n\nSome exclamations start with a question word such as \"how\" or \"why,\" even though they are not questions. The sentence below shows that the speaker is amazed at how unsearchable God's judgments are.\n\n><u>How</u> unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)\n\nSome exclamations in the Bible do not have a main verb. The exclamation below shows that the speaker is disgusted with the person he is speaking to.\n\n>You worthless person! (Matthew 5:22 ULB)\n\n#### Translation Strategies\n\n1. If an exclamation in your language needs a verb, add one. Often a good verb is \"is\" or \"are.\"\n1. Use a word word from your language that shows the strong feeling. \n1. Translate the exclamation word with a sentence that shows the feeling.\n1.

Use an exclamation word from from your language that shows the strong feeling. The word \"wow\" below shows that they were astonished. The expression \"Oh no\" shows that something terrible or frightening has happened.\n\n  * **They were absolutely astonished, saying, \"He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.\"** (Mark 7:36 ULB)\n      * \"They were absolutely astonished, saying, \"<u>Wow</u>! He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.\" \"\n\n  * **Ah, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!** (Judges 6:22 ULB)\n      * \"__Oh no__, Lord Yahweh!

He does this in order to effectively describe the first situation by implying that in some important way it is similar to the other. The second situation has multiple **images** of people, things, and actions that represent those in the first situation. \n \n#### Reasons this is a translation issue \n\n  * People may not realize that the images represent other things.\n  * People may not be familiar with the things that are used as images. \n  * Extended metaphors are often so profound that it would be impossible for a translator to show all of the meaning generated by the metaphor.\n\n#### Translation Principles  \n\n  * Make the meaning of the extended metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.\n  * Do not make the meaning more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.\n  * When someone uses an extended metaphor, the images are an important part of what he is trying to say.\n  * If the target audience is not familiar with some of the images, you will need to find some way of helping them understand the images so they can understand the whole extended metaphor.\n\n### Examples from the Bible \n\nIn Psalm 23:1-4, the writer says that God's concern and care for his people can be pictured as the care that a shepherd has for his flock of sheep. Shepherds give sheep what they need, take them to safe places, rescue them, guide them, and protect them. What God does for his people is like these actions.\n\n><sup>1</sup>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.  \n><sup>2</sup>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;  \n>he leads me beside tranquil water.  \n><sup>3</sup>He brings back my life;  \n>he guides me along right paths for his name's sake.  \n><sup>4</sup>Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow,  \n>I will not fear harm since you are with me;  \n>your rod and your staff comfort me. (ULB)\n\nIn Isaiah 5:1-7, Isaiah presents God's disappointment with his people as the disappointment that a farmer would feel if his vineyard only produced bad fruit. Farmers care for their gardens, but if they only produce bad fruit, farmers eventually stop caring for them. Verses 1 through 6 appear to be simply about a farmer and his vineyard, but verse 7 makes it clear that it is about God and his people.\n\n><sup>1</sup>...My well beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.  \n><sup>2</sup>He spaded it and removed the stones, and planted it with the choicest vine.  \n>He built a tower in the middle of it, and also built a winepress.  \n>He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced wild grapes.   \n\n><sup>3</sup>So now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah;  \n>judge between me and my vineyard.  \n><sup>4</sup>What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it?  \n>When I looked for it to produce grapes, why did it produce wild grapes?  \n><sup>5</sup> Now I will inform you what I will do to my vineyard; I will remove the hedge;  \n>I will turn it into a pasture; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled on.  \n><sup>6</sup>I will lay it waste, and it will not be pruned nor hoed. But briers and thorns will spring up,  \n> I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.\n\n><sup>7</sup>For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts is the house of Israel,  \n>and the men of Judah his pleasant planting;  \n>he waited for justice, but instead, there was killing;  \n>for righteousness, but, instead, a cry for help. (ULB)\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nConsider using the same extended metaphor if your readers will understand it in the same way the original readers would have.  If not, here are some other strategies:\n\n1. If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, translate it as a simile by using \"like\" or \"as\". It may be enough to to do this in just the first sentence or two.\n1. If the target audience would not know the image, find a way of translating it so they can understand what the image is.\n1. If the target audience still would not understand, then state it clearly.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied \n\n1)  If the target audience would think that the images should be understood literally, translate it as a simile by using \"like\" or \"as.\" It may be enough to to do this in just the first sentence or two.  See Psalm 23:1-2 as an example:\n\n>**Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing.**  \n>**He makes me to lie down in green pastures;**  \n>**he leads me beside tranquil water.

In other parts of the Bible, those words include both men and women. When the writer meant both men and women, translators need to translate it in a way that does not limit the meaning to men.\n\n### Description\n\nIn some languages a word that normally refers to men can be used to refer to both men and women. For example, the Bible sometimes says 'brothers' when it refers to both brothers and sisters. \n\nAlso in some languages, the masculine pronouns \"he\" and \"him\" can be used for any person if it is not import whether the person is a man or women. In the example below, the pronoun is \"his,\" but it is not limited to males.\n>A wise child makes <u>his</u> father rejoice  \n>but a foolish child brings grief to <u>his</u> mother. (Proverbs 10:1 ULB)\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\n  * In some cultures words like \"man,\" \"brother,\" and \"son\" can only be used to refer to men. If those words are used in a translation, people will think that what is being said does not apply to women.\n  * In some cultures, the masculine pronouns \"he\" and \"him\" can only refer to men. If a masculine pronoun is used, people will think that what is said does not apply to women.\n\n#### Translation Principles\n\nWhen a statement applies to both men and women, translate it in such a way that people will be able to understand that.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n> The wise <u>man</u> dies just like the fool dies. (Ecclesiastes 2:16 ULB)\n\nThis verse is not speaking only of men, but of men and women.\n\n> Then said Jesus to his disciples, \"If anyone wants to follow me, <u>he</u> must deny <u>himself</u>, take up <u>his</u> cross, and follow me.\" (Matthew 16:24-26 ULB)\n\nJesus was not speaking only of men, but of men and women.\n\n**Caution**: Sometimes masculine words are used specifically to refer to men.

Otherwise, here are some ways for translating those words when they include women. \n\n  1. Use a noun that can be used for both men and women.\n  1.

Use a word that refers to men and a word that refers to women.\n\n  * **For we do not want you to be ignorant, <u>brothers</u>, about the troubles we had in Asia** (2 Corinthians 1:8) - Paul was writing this letter to both men and women.\n      * \"For we do not want you to be ignorant, <u>brothers and sisters</u>, about the troubles we had in Asia\" (2 Corinthians 1:8)\n\n3. Use pronouns that can be used for both men and women.\n\n  * **If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.\"** (Matthew 16:24 ULB) - English speakers can change the singular pronouns \"he\" \"himself\" and \"his\" to plural pronouns \"they\" \"themselves\" and \"their\" in order to show that it applies to all people, not just men.\n      * \"If people want to follow me, <u>they</u> must deny <u>themselves</u>, take up <u>their</u> cross, and follow me.\"\n\n",

Structure involves how we put words together to form phrase, clauses, and sentences.\n\n**Parts of Speech** - All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech.  (See: [Parts of Speech](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_partsofspeech.md))\n\n**Sentences** -  When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See: [Sentence Structure](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentences.md))\n\n  * Sentences can be statements, questions, commands or exclamations. (See: [Exclamations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentencetypes.md))\n  * Sentences can have more than one clause. (See: [Sentence Structure](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentences.md))\n  * Some languages have both active and  passive sentences (See: [Active or Passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_activepassive.md))\n\n**Possession** - This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with \"of\" as in \"the love of God,\" or with \"'s\" as in \"God's love,\" or with a possessive pronoun as in \"his love.\" (See [Possession](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_possession.md))\n\n**Quotations** -  A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.  \n\n  * Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See: [Quotations and Quote Margins](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_quotations.md)) \n  * Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes  (See: [Direct and Indirect Quotations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotations.md)) \n  * Quotes can have quotes within them (See: [Quotes within Quotes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotesinquotes.md))  \n  * Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what.

He may greatly exaggerate something in order to show his strong feeling or opinion about it, or he may generalize the situation by using words like \"every\" or \"all\" to mean \"many.\" \n\n### Description\n\nHyperbole is a figure of speech in which the speaker shows that something is very important by describing it as larger or greater than it really is. There are two kinds of hyperbole:\n\n1. Exaggeration: This is when a speaker deliberately describes something by an extreme or even unreal statement, usually to show his strong feeling or opinion about it.\n>Whoever does not <u>carry his own cross</u> and come after me cannot be my disciple. (Luke 14:27 ULB) - This is an exaggeration. It means that whoever wants to be Jesus' disciple must be determined to follow him faithfully, even if his enemies were to kill that person.\n\n2. Generalization: This is when a speaker uses words like \"every\" or \"all\" to mean something like \"very many,\" but not \"<u>every</u>  one.\" (Some people may not call generalization like this \"hyperbole.\")\n>Moses was educated in <u>all the learning of the Egyptians</u> (Acts 7:22 ULB) - This is a generalization. It means that he had learned much of what the Egyptians knew and taught.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\nIf readers do not understand that a statement is a hyperbole, they may either think that something happened that did not happen, or they may think that the speaker or writer was saying something that is not true. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n#### Examples of Exaggeration\n\n>If your hand causes you to stumble, <u>cut it off</u>. It is better for you to enter into life maimed… (Mark 9:43 ULB)\n\nWhen Jesus said to cut off your hand, he meant that we should do whatever extreme things we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to try to stop sinning. \n>If anyone comes to me and does not <u>hate</u> his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters--yes, and his own life also--he cannot be my disciple. (Luke 14:26 ULB) \n\nBecause of many other things that Jesus said, we know that his use of the word \"hate\" here is hyperbole. He meant that we must not love even our own family members more than we love him. We must love him more than we love ourselves or anyone else.\n>The Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand men to drive the chariots, and troops <u>as numerous as the sand on the seashore</u>. (1 Samuel 13:5 ULB)\n\nThe underlined phrase is an exaggeration. It means that there were  many, many soldiers in the Philistine army. \n\n#### Examples of Generalization\n\n>They found him, and they said to him, \"<u>Everyone</u> is looking for you.\" (Mark 1:37 ULB)\n\nThe disciples told Jesus that everyone was looking looking for him. They probably did not mean that everyone in the city was looking for him, but that many people were looking for him, or that all of Jesus closest friends there were looking for him.\n>But as his anointing teaches you about <u>all things</u> and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, remain in him. (1 John 2:27 ULB)  \n\n This is a generalization. God's Spirit teaches us about all things that we need to know.\n\n#### Caution\n\nDo not assume that something is hyperbole just because it seems to be impossible. God does miraculous things.\n>… they saw Jesus <u>walking on the sea</u> and coming near the boat … (John 6:19 ULB)  \n\nThis  is not hyperbole. Jesus really walked on the water. It is a literal statement.\n>… for <u>all</u> have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  (Romans 3:23 ULB) \n\nThe word \"all\" here is not hyperbole. All humans have sinned. The only human who has never sinned is Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the hyperbole would be natural and people would understand it and not think that it is a lie, consider using it. If not, here is another option.\n\n  1. Express the meaning without the hyperbole. For example \"all the people\" could be translated as \"large crowds of people.\"\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Express the meaning without the hyperbole.\n\n* **If anyone comes to me and does not <u>hate</u> his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple.** (Luke 14:26 ULB)\n    * \"If anyone comes to me and does not <u>love me much more than</u> he loves his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple.\" \n\n* **The Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand men to drive the chariots, and troops <u>as numerous as the sand on the seashore</u>.** (1 Samuel 13:5 ULB)\n    * \"The Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand men to drive the chariots, and <u>a great number of troops</u>.\"\n\n\n",

Sometimes imperative sentences in the Bible have other uses.\n\n**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages would not use an imperative sentence for some of the functions that they are used for in the Bible.\n\n### Examples from the Bible \n\nSpeakers often use imperative sentences to tell or ask their listeners to do something. In Genesis 2, God spoke to Isaac and told him not to go to Egypt but to live where God would tell him to live.\n\n> Now Yahweh appeared to him and said, \"Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land that I tell you to live in. (Genesis 26:2 ULB)\n\nSometimes imperative sentences in the Bible have other uses. \n\n#### Imperatives that make things happen\n\nGod can make things happen by commanding that they happen. Jesus healed a man by commanding that the man be healed. The man could not obey the command, but Jesus caused him to be healed by commanding it. (\"Be clean\" means \"Be healed.\")\n> \"I am willing. _Be clean_.\" Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. (Matthew 8:3 ULB)\n\nIn Genesis 1, God commanded that there should be light, and by commanding it, he caused it to exist.\n>God said, \"_Let there be light_,\" and there was light. (Genesis 1:3 ULB)\n\n#### Imperatives that Function as Conditions  \nAn imperative sentence can also be used to tell the **condition** under which something will happen.  The proverbs mainly tell about life and things that often happen. The purpose of Proverbs 4:6 below is not primarily to give a command, but to teach what people can expect to happen **if** they love wisdom.\n\n>do not abandon wisdom and she will watch over you; \n>love her and she will keep you safe. (Proverbs 4:6 ULB)\n\nThe purpose of Proverbs 22:6 below is teach what people can expect to happen _if_ they teach their children the way they should go. \n\n>Teach a child the way he should go,\n>and when he is old he will not turn away from that instruction. (Proverbs 22:6 ULB)\n\n### Translation Strategies \n\n1. If people would not use an imperative sentence to cause something to happen, try using a statement instead.\n1. If people would not understand that a sentence is used to cause something to happen, add a connecting word like \"so\" to show that what happened was a result of what was said.\n1. If people would not use a command as a condition, translate it as a statement with the word \"if.\" \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied \n\n1.

In this case it does not distinguish this sister from another sister that Mary might have. It simply gives added information about that sister.\n\n### Description\n\nSome languages can use a word or phrase with a noun to give information about that noun or to remind people of something about it.\n\n* Mary gave some of the food to her sister, _who was very thankful_.\n\nThe phrase \"who was very thankful\" immediately follows the word \"sister\" and informs us about how Mary's sister responded when Mary gave her the food. In this case it does not distinguish this sister from another sister that Mary might have.\n\n**Reason people use these phrases**: People often present either reminders or new information in a weak way. They do this when they want their listener to give most of his attention to something else they are saying. In the example above, the speaker wants most attention to be given to what Mary did, NOT to how her sister responded.\n\n**Reason this is a translation Issue:** Languages have different ways of signaling the parts of communication that the listener should pay most attention to. \n\n#### Translation Principles \n* If your language does not use phrases with a noun for new information or a reminder, you may need to put that information or reminder in a different part of the sentence.  \n* Try to present it in a weak way.  \n* Ask  yourself: In our language, how do we express information in a strong way, and how do we express it in a weaker way? \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>The name of the third river is Tigris, _which flows east of Asshur_. (Genesis 2:14 ULB)\n\nThere is only one Tigris River. The phrase \"which flows east of Asshur\" gives more information about where the Tigris River was. This would have been helpful to the original audience, because they knew were Asshur was.\n\n>I will wipe away mankind _whom I have created_ from the surface of the earth. (Genesis 6:7 ULB) \n\nThe phrase \"whom I have created\" is a reminder of the relationship between God and mankind. It is the reason God had the right to wipe away mankind. \n\n>I will bring an end to the _worthless_  idols of Memphis. (Ezekiel 30:13 ULB)\n\nAll idols are worthless. This is why God said he would destroy them.  \n\n>for your _righteous_  judgments are good. (Psalm 119:39 ULB)\n \nAll of God's judgments are righteous. This is why the person who wrote this psalm said that they are good. \n\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf people would understand the purpose of a phrase with a noun, then consider keeping the phrase and the noun together. Otherwise here are other strategies of showing that the phrase is used to inform or remind.\n\n1. Put the information in another part of the sentence and add words that show its purpose.   \n1. Use one of your language's ways for expressing information in a weak way. It may be by adding a small word, or by changing the way the voice sounds. Sometimes changes in the voice can be shown with punctuation marks, such as parentheses or commas. \n\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Put the information in another part of the sentence and add words that show its purpose.\n\n  * **I hate those who serve _worthless_ idols**  (Psalm 31:6 ULB) - By saying \"worthless idols,\" David was commenting about all idols and giving his reason for hating those who serve them. He was not distinguishing worthless idols from valuable idols.  \n\t  * \"_Because_ idols are worthless, I hate those who serve them.\" \n\n  * **for your _righteous_ judgments are good.**  (Psalm 119:39 ULB)  \n\t  * \"for your judgments are good _because_ they are righteous.  \n\n  * **Can Sarah, _who is ninety years old_, bear a son?**  (Genesis 17:17-18 ULB) - The phrase \"who is ninety years old\" is a reminder of Sarah's age. It tells why Abraham was asking the question. He did not expect that a woman who was that old could bear a child.  \n\t  * \"Can Sarah bear a son _even when_ she is ninety years old?\" \n\n  * **I will call on Yahweh, _who is worthy to be praised_**  (2 Samuel 22:4 ULB) - There is only one Yahweh. The phrase \"who is worthy to be praised\" gives a reason for calling on Yahweh. \n\t  * \"I will call on Yahweh, _because_ he is worthy to be praised\"\n\n2.

When it does, it acts like a noun. For example, the word \"rich\" is an adjective. Here are two sentences that show that \"rich\" is an adjective.\n> <u>The rich man</u> had huge numbers of flocks and herds, (2 Samuel 12:2 ULB)\n\nThe adjective \"rich\" comes before the word \"man\" and describes \"man.\"\n><u>He will not be rich</u>; his wealth will not last; (Job 15:29 ULB)\n\nThe adjective \"rich\" comes after the verb \"be\" and describes \"He.\"\n>…<u>the rich</u> must not give more than the half shekel, and <u>the poor</u> must not give less.

There are different kinds of parallelism. Some of them are the following: \n\n  1. The second clause or phrase means the same as the first. \n  1. The second clarifies or strengthens the meaning of the first. \n  1. The second completes what is said in the first. \n  1. The second says something that contrasts with the first. \n\nParallelism is most commonly found in Old Testament poetry, such as in the books of Psalms and Proverbs.  It also occurs in Greek in the New Testament, both in the four gospels and in the apostles' letters.  \n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\nSome languages would not use the kind of parallelism in which the two phrases mean the same thing. They would either think it odd that someone said the same thing twice, or they think that the two phrases must have some difference in meaning.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nThe second clause or phrase means the same as the first. \n\n>You make him to rule over the works of your hands;  \n>you have put all things under his feet (Psalm 8:6 ULB)\n\n* Both lines say that God made man the ruler of everything. \n\nThe second clarifies or strengthens the meaning of the first.\n\n>The eyes of Yahweh are everywhere,  \n>keeping watch over the evil and the good. (Proverbs 15:3 ULB)  \n\n* The second line tells more specifically what Yahweh watches. \n\nThe second completes what is said in the first. \n\n>I lift up my voice to Yahweh,  \n>and he answers me from his holy hill. (Psalm 3:4 ULB)\n\n* The second line tells what Yahweh does in response to what the person does in the first clause. \n\nThe second says something that contrasts with the first. \n\n>For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous,  \n>but the way of the wicked will perish. (Psalm 1:6 ULB)\n\n* This contrasts what happens to righteous people with what happens to wicked people. \n\n>A gentle answer turns away wrath,  \n>but a harsh word stirs up anger. (Proverbs 15:1 ULB)\n\n* This contrasts what happens when someone gives a gentle answer with what happens when someone says something harsh.  \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. For most kinds of parallelism, it is good to translate both of the clauses or phrases.   \n  1. When the two clauses or phrases mean the same thing, some languages would not translate them both.

All languages have parts of speech, and all words in a language belong to a part of speech. All languages have some of these parts of speech, and some languages have others.  This is not an exhaustive list of parts of speech, but it covers the basics.\n\n**VERBS** are words that express either an action (such as come, go, eat) or a state-of-being (such as is, are, was.) More detailed information can be found on [Verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_verbs.md).\n\n**NOUNS** are words that represent a person, place, thing, or idea. Common nouns are generic (man, city, country). Names are capitalized and refer to a specific entity (Peter, Jerusalem, Egypt). For more information see [How to Translate Names](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_names.md).\n\n**PRONOUNS** take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we. More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on [Pronouns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_pronouns.md).\n\n**CONJUNCTIONS** are words that join phrases or sentences. Examples include: and, or, but, for, yet, nor. Some conjunctions are used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also. More information about these can be found on [Connecting Words](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_connectingwords.md))\n\n**PREPOSITIONS** are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, \"The boat was <u>off the shore</u>.\" Here the phrase with the preposition \"off\" tells the location of the boat in relations to the shore. Another example is \"The crowd <u>around Jesus</u> grew in numbers.\" The phrase with the preposition \"around\" tells the location of the people in relation to Jesus. Some examples of prepositions are: to, from, in, out, on, off, with, without, above, below, before, after, behind, in front of, among, through, beyond, among.\n\n**ARTICLES** are words that are used with nouns to show whether or not the speaker is referring to something that his listener should be able to identify. In English these words are: a, an, the. The words \"a\" and \"an\" mean the same thing. If a speaker says \"<u>a</u> dog\" he does not expect his listener to know which dog he is talking about; this might be the first time he says anything about a dog. If a speaker says \"<u>the</u> dog,\" he is usually referring to a specific dog, and he expects his listener to know which dog he is talking about. English speakers also use \"the\" to show that they are talking about something in general. For example the can say \"<u>The</u> elephant is a large animal\" and refer to elephants in general, not a specific elephant. More information about this can be found on [Generic Noun Phrases](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_genericnoun.md).\n\n**ADJECTIVES** are words that describe nouns and express such things as quantity, size, color, and age. Some examples: many, big, blue, old, smart, tired. Sometimes people use adjectives to give some information about something, and sometimes people use them to distinguish one item from another. For example, in \"my elderly father\" the adjective \"elderly\" simply tells something about my father.  But in \"my eldest sister\" the word \"eldest\" distinguishes that sister from any other older sisters I might have. More information about this can be found on [Distinguishing versus Informing or Reminding](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_distinguish.md).\n\n**ADVERBS** are words that describe verbs or adjectives and tell such things as how, when, where, why, to what extent. Many English adverbs end in 'ly.' Some examples of adverbs: slowly, later, far, intentionally, very.\n\n",

Use the words \"like\" or \"as\" to show that the sentences is not to be understood literally.\n\n  * **sin crouches at the door** (Genesis 4:7 ULB) - This can be translated with the word \"as.\"\n      * \"sin is about to destroy you, just <u>as</u> a wild animal could harm a person.\"\n\n3.

In English that grammatical relationship is shown with \"of,\" or an apostrophe and the letter \"s,\" or a possessive pronoun.\n\n  * the house <u>of</u> my grandfather\n  * my grandfather<u>'s</u> house\n  * <u>his</u> house\n\nPossession is used in Hebrew, Greek, and English for a variety of situations. Here are a few common situations that it is used for.\n\n  * Ownership - Someone owns something.\n    * My clothes - The clothes that I own\n  * Social relationship - Someone has some kind of social relationship with another.\n    * my mother -  the woman who gave birth to me, or the woman who cared for me\n    * my teacher - the person who teaches me\n  * Contents - Something has something in it.\n    * a bag of potatoes - a bag that has potatoes in it, or a bag that is full of potatoes\n  * Part and whole: One thing is part of another.\n     * my head - the head that is part of my body\n     * the roof of a house - the roof that is part of a house\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * Translators need to understand the relationship between two ideas represented by the two nouns when one possesses the other.\n  * Some languages do not use possession for all of the situations that your source text Bible might use it for.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n**Ownership** - In the example below, the son owned the money.\n>… the younger son … wasted <u>his money</u> with wildly extravagant living. (Luke 15:13)\n\n**Social Relationship** - In the example below, the disciples were people who learned from John.\n>Then <u>the disciples of John</u> came to him …,  (Matthew 9:14 ULB)\n\n**Material** - In the example below, the material used for make the crowns was gold.\n>On their heads were something like <u>crowns of gold</u> (Revelation 9:7)\n\n**Contents** - In the example below, the cup has water in it.\n>Whoever gives you <u>a cup of water</u> to drink … will not lose his reward.  (Mark 9:41 ULB)\n\n**Part of a whole** - In the example below, the door was a part of the palace.\n>But Uriah slept at <u>the door of the king's palace</u>  (2 Samuel 11:9 ULB) \n\n**Part of a group** - In the example below, the whole group is \"us\" and \"each one\" refers to the individual members. \n>To <u>each one of us</u> has been given a gift (Ephesians 4:7 ULB)\n\n#### Events and Possession\n\nSometimes one or both of the nouns is an abstract noun that refers to an event or action. In the examples below, the abstract nouns are in **bold** print. These are just some of the relationships that are possible between two nouns when one of them refers to an event.  \n\n**Subject** - Sometimes the word after \"of\" tells who would do the action named by the first noun. In the example below, John baptized people.\n>The <u>**baptism** of John</u>, was it from heaven or from men? Answer me.\" (Mark 11:30)\n\nIn the example below, Christ loves us.\n>Who will separate us from <u>the **love** of Christ</u>? (Romans 3:35)\n\n**Object** - Sometimes the word after \"of\" tells who or what something would happen to. In the example below, people love money.\n>For <u>the **love** of money</u> is a root of all kinds of evil. (1 Timothy 6:10 ULB)\n\n**Instrument** - Sometimes the word after \"of\" tells how something would happen. In the example below, God would punish people by sending enemies to attack them with swords. \n> then be afraid of the sword, because wrath brings <u>the **punishment** of the sword</u> (Job 19:29 ULB) \n\n**Representation** - In the example below, John was baptizing people who were repenting of their sins. They were being baptized to show that they were repenting. Their baptism represented their repentance.\n>As John came, he was baptizing in the wilderness and was preaching <u>a **baptism** of repentance</u> for the forgiveness of sins. (Mark 1:4 ULB)\n\n### Strategies for learning what the relationship is between the two nouns\n\n  1. Read the surrounding verses to see if they help you to understand the relationship between the two nouns.\n  1. Read the verse in the UDB. Sometimes it shows the relationship clearly.\n  1. See what the notes say about it.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf possession would be a natural way to show a particular relationship between two nouns, consider using it. If it would be strange or hard to understand, consider these.\n\n  1. Use an adjective to show that one describes the other.\n  1. Use a verb to show how the two are related. \n  1. If one of the nouns refers to an event, translate it as a verb.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Use an adjective to show that one describes the other. The adjective below is in **bold** print.\n\n  * **On their heads were something like <u>crowns of gold</u>** (Revelation 9:7)\n      * \"On their heads were <u>**gold** crowns</u>\"\n\n2. Use a verb to show how the two are related. In the example below, the added verb is in bold.\n\n  * **Whoever gives you <u>a cup of water</u> to drink … will not lose his reward.**  (Mark 9:41 ULB)\n      * \"Whoever gives you <u>a cup that **has** water in it</u> to drink  … will not lose his reward.\n\n  * **Wealth is worthless on <u>the day of wrath</u>** (Proverbs 11:4 ULB)\n      * Wealth is worthless on <u>the day when God **shows** his wrath</u>\"\n      * Wealth is worthless on the day when God **punishes** people because of his wrath.\n\n3. If one of the nouns refers to an event, translate it as a verb. In the example below, that verb is in bold.\n\n  * **Notice that I am not speaking to your children, who have not known or seen <u>the punishment of Yahweh your God</u>,** (Deuteronomy 11:2 ULB)\n      * \"Notice that I am not speaking to your children who have not known or seen <u>how Yahweh your God **punished** the people of Egypt.</u>\"\n\n  * **You will only observe and see the <u>punishment of the wicked</u>.** (Psalms 91:8 ULB)\n      * You will only observe and see the <u>how Yahweh **punishes** the wicked</u>. \n\n  * **you will receive the gift <u>of the Holy Spirit</u>.** (Acts 2:38 ULB)\n      * \"you will receive <u>the Holy Spirit, whom God will **give** to you</u>.\"\n\n\n",

Some examples are I, you, he, it, this, that, himself, someone. \n\n### Description\n\nPronouns are words that people use instead of a noun to refer to someone or something. There are six different types of pronouns.\n\n### Personal Pronouns\n\nPersonal pronouns refer to people or things and show if the speaker is referring to himself, the person he is speaking to, or someone or something else. The following are kinds of information that personal pronouns may give.\n\n#### Person\n\n  * First Person - The speaker and possibly others  (I, we)\n    * [Inclusive \"We\"](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_inclusive.md)\n    * [Exclusive \"We\"](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_exclusive.md)\n  * Second Person - The person or people that the speaker is talking to and possibly others  (you) \n    * [Forms of You](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_you.md)\n  * Third Person - Someone or something other than the speaker and those he is talking to (he, she, it, they)\n\n#### Number\n\n  * Singular - one  (I, you, he, she, it) \n  * Plural - more than one  (we, you, they)\n  * Dual - two (Some languages have pronouns for specifically two people or two things.)\n\n#### Gender\n\n  * Masculine - he\n  * Feminine - she\n  * Neuter - it\n\n#### Relationship to other words in the sentence\n\n  * Subject of the verb: I, you, he, she, it, we, they\n  * Object of the verb or preposition: me, you, him, her, it, us, them\n  * Possessor with a noun: my, your, his, her, its, our, their\n  * Possessor without a noun: mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs\n\n### Other Types of pronouns\n\n**[Reflexive Pronouns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_rpronouns.md)** refer to another noun or pronoun in the same sentence: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves.\n\n  * **John saw <u>himself</u> in the mirror.** - The word \"himself\" refers to John.\n\n**Interrogative Pronouns** are used to make a question that needs more than just a yes or no for an answer: who, whom, whose, what, where, when, why, how\n\n  * **<u>Who</u> built the house?**\n\n**Relative Pronouns** mark a relative clause: that, which, who, whom, where, when \n\n  * **I saw the house <u>that</u> John built.** The clause \"that John built\" tells which house I saw.\n  * **I saw the man <u>who</u> built the house.** The clause \"who built the house\" tells which man I saw.\n\n**Demonstrative Pronouns** are used to draw attention to someone or something and to show distance from the speaker or something else: this, these, that, those. \\\\ \n\n  * **Have you seen <u>this</u> here?**\n  * **Who is <u>that</u> over there?**\n\n**Indefinite pronouns** are used when no particular noun is being referred to: any, anyone, someone, anything, something, some. Sometimes a personal pronoun is used: you, they, he or it.\n\n  * **He does not want to talk to <u>anyone</u>.** \n  * **<u>Someone</u> fixed it, but I do not know who.** \n\n",

In some languages, reported speech can be expressed by direct or indirect quotations.\n\n* Direct Quotation: John said, \"I do not know at what time I will arrive.\"\n* Indirect Quotation: John said that he did not know what time he would arrive.\nWhen translating a quotation, translators need to decide whether to translate it as a direct quotation or an indirect quotation.\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at http://ufw.io/figs_quotations.\n\n### Description\n\nA **direct quotation** occurs when someone reports what another person said from the viewpoint of that original speaker. People usually expect that this kind of quotation will represent the original speaker's exact words. In the example below, John would have said \"I\" when referring to himself, so the narrator, who is telling about John John saying this, uses the word in the quotation \"I\" to refer to John. \n\n  * John said, \"<u>I</u> do not know at what time <u>I</u> will arrive.\" \n\nAn **indirect quotation** occurs when a speaker reports what someone else said, but in this case, the speaker is reporting it from his own point of view instead of from the original person's point of view. This kind of quotation usually features changes in pronouns, and it often features changes in time, in word choices, and in length.   In the example below, the narrator refers to John as \"he\" in the quotation and uses the word \"would,\" which is the past tense of \"will.\"\n\n  * John said that <u>he</u>  did not know what time <u>he</u>  would arrive.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nThe verses in the examples below have both direct and indirect quotations. In the explanation below the verse, we have underlined the quotations. \n>He instructed him to tell no one, but told him, \"Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.\" (Luke 5:14 ULB)\n\n  * Indirect quote: He instructed him <u>to tell no one</u>,\n  * Direct quote: but told him, \"<u>Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest…</u>\"\n\n>Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus answered them and said, \"The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed. Neither will they say, 'Look here!' or, 'Look there!' because the kingdom of God is among you.\"  (Luke 17:20-21 ULB)\n\n  * Indirect quote: Being asked by the Pharisees <u>when the kingdom of God would come,</u> \n  * Direct quote: Jesus answered them and said, \"<u>The kingdom of God is not something that can be observed. Neither will they say, 'Look here!' or, 'Look there!' because the kingdom of God is among you.</u>\" \n  * Direct quotes:  Neither will they say, '<u>Look here!</u>' or, '<u>Look there!</u>'\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the kind of quote used in the source text would work well in your language, consider using it. \n\n  1. If a direct quote would not work well in your language, change it to an indirect quote.\n  1.

When a quote has quotes within it, we can talk about it having layers of quotation, and each of the quotes is a layer.  When there are many layers of quotes inside of quotes, it can be hard for listeners and readers to know who is saying what. Some languages use a combination of direct quotes and indirect quotes to make it easier. \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  1. When there  is a quote within a quote, the listener needs to know who the pronouns refer to. For example if a quote that is inside a quote has the word \"I,\" the listener needs to know whether \"I\" refers to the speaker of the inner quote or the outer quote.\n  1. Some languages make this clear by using different kinds of quotes when there are quotes within quotes. They may use direct quotes for some and indirect quotes for others.\n  1. Some languages do not use indirect quotes.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n#### A quotation with only one layer\n\n> But Paul said, \"I was born a Roman citizen.\" (Acts 22:28 ULB)\n\n#### Quotations with two layers\n\n>Jesus answered and said to them, \"Be careful that no one leads you astray.

This page will help you understand how English shows this and will help you to see how your language handles this. \n\n### Description\n\n**Reflexive pronouns** are pronouns that refer to someone or something that has already been mentioned in a sentence. In English the reflexive pronouns are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n  * Languages have different ways of referring to someone or something more than once in a sentence.\n  * The reflexive pronouns in English have other functions.\n\n#### Uses of Reflexive Pronouns\n\n  * to show that the same person or things fills two different roles in a sentence\n  * to emphasize a person or thing in the sentence\n  * to show that someone did something alone \n  * to show that someone or something was alone\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nReflexive pronouns used to that show that the same person or things fills two different roles in a sentence\n<blockquote>If <u>I</u> should testify about <u>myself</u> alone, my testimony would not be true. (John 5:31 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and <u>many</u> went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify <u>themselves</u>. (John 11:55 ULB) \n\nReflexive pronouns used to emphasize a person or thing in the sentence\n<blockquote><u>Jesus himself</u> was not baptizing, but his disciples were (John 4:2 ULB)  </blockquote>\n\n> So they left the crowd, taking <u>Jesus</u> with them, since he was already in the boat. Other boats were also with him. And a violent windstorm arose and the waves were breaking into the boat so that the boat was already full. But <u>Jesus himself</u> was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. (Mark 4:36-38 ULB)\n\nReflexive pronouns used to show that someone did something alone \n>When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain <u>by himself</u>. (John 6:15 ULB) \n\nReflexive pronouns used to show that someone or something was alone\n>He saw the linen cloths lying there and the cloth that had been on his head. <u>It</u> was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in its place by <u>itself</u>. (John 20:6-7 ULB)  \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf a reflexive pronoun would have the same function in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other strategies.\n\n1. In some languages people put something on the verb to show that the object of the verb is the same as the subject. \n1. In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by referring to it in a special place in the sentence. \n1. In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by adding something to that word or putting another word with it.\n1. In some languages people show that someone did something alone by using a word like \"alone.\" \n1. In some languages people show that something was alone by using a phrase that tells about where it was.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. In some languages people put something on the verb to show that the object of the verb is the same as the subject. \n\n  * **If I should testify about <u>myself</u> alone, my testimony would not be true.** (John 5:31)\n      * \"If I should <u>self-testify</u> alone, my testimony would not be true.\" \n\n  * **Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to <u>purify themselves</u>.** (John 11:55) \n      * \"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to <u>self-purify</u>.\"\n\n2. In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by referring to it in a special place in the sentence. \n\n  * **<u>He himself</u> took our sickness and bore our diseases.** (Matthew 8:17 ULB)\n      * \"<u>It was he who</u>  took our sickness and bore our diseases.\"\n\n  * **<u>Jesus himself</u> was not baptizing, but his disciples were.** (John 4:2)\n      * \"<u>It was not Jesus who</u> was baptizing, but his disciples were.\"\n\n3. In some languages people emphasize a certain person or thing by adding something to that word or putting another word with it. English adds the reflexive pronoun.\n\n  * **Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he <u>himself</u> knew what he was going to do.** (John 6:6)\n\n4. In some languages people show that someone did something alone by using a word like \"alone.\"\n\n  * **When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the mountain <u>by himself</u>.** (John 6:15)\n      * \"When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again <u>alone</u> up the mountain.\" \n\n5. In some languages people show that something was alone by using a phrase that tells about where it was.\n\n  * **He saw the linen cloths lying there and the cloth that had been on his head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in its place <u>by itself</u>.** (John 20:6-7 ULB)  \n      * \"He saw the linen cloths lying there and the cloth that had been on his head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up and lying <u>in a different place</u>.\"\n\n\n",

      "file": "---\ntitle: Sentence Structure\nquestion: What are the parts of a sentence?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: figs_sentences\ndependencies:  [\"figs_partsofspeech\"]\nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: [\"figs_order\", \"figs_distinguish\"]\noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/translate/sentencestructure\ncredits: \n---\n\n\n### Description \n\nThe simplest sentence structure in English includes a  **subject** and an **action** word: \n\n  * The boy ran.\n\n#### Subject \n\nThe ***subject*** is who or what the sentence is about. In these examples, the subject is underlined: \n\n* <u>The boy</u>  is running.\n* <u>He</u> is running.\n\nSubjects are typically noun phrases or pronouns. (See: [Parts of Speach](figs_partsofspeech.md)) In the examples above, \"the boy\" is a noun phrase that has the noun 'boy,' and \"he\" is a pronoun.\n\nWhen the sentence is a command, it usually does not have a subject pronoun. People understand that the subject is \"you.\"\n\n* Close the door.\n\n#### Predicate \n\nThe predicate is the part of a sentence that tells something about the subject. It usually has a verb. (See: [Verbs](figs_verbs.md))  In the sentences below, the subjects are \"the man\" and \"he.\" The predicates are underlined and the verbs are in bold.\n\n  * The man <u>**is** strong</u>.\n  * He <u>**worked** hard</u>.\n  * He <u>**made** a garden</u>.\n\n#### Compound Sentences \n\nA sentence can be made up of more than one sentence. Each of the two lines below has a subject and a predicate and is a full sentence.\n\n  * He planted the yams.\n  * His wife planted the corn.\n\nThe compound sentence below has the two sentences above. In English, compound sentences are joined with a conjunction such as \"and,\" \"but,\" or \"or\".\n\n  * He planted the yams <u>and</u> his wife planted the corn.\n\n#### Clauses \n\nSentences can also have clauses and other phrases. Clauses are like sentences because they have a subject and a predicate, but they do not normally occur by themselves. Here are some examples of clauses. The subjects are in bold, and the predicates are underlined.\n\n  * when **the corn** <u>was ready</u>\n  * after **she** <u>picked it</u>\n  * because **it** <u>tasted so good</u>\n\nClauses are usually only part of a sentence. The clauses are underlined in the sentences below.\n\n  * <u>When the corn was ready</u>, she picked it.\n  * <u>After she picked it</u>, she carried it home and cooked it.\n  * Then she and her husband ate it all, <u>because it tasted so good</u>.\n\nThe following phrases can be a whole sentence.\n\n  * She picked it.\n  * She carried it home and cooked it.\n  * Then she and her husband ate it all.\n\nNote: We are using the word **clause** for 'dependent clause' and **sentence** for 'independent clause.' \n\n#### Relative Clauses \n\nIn some languages, clauses can be used with a noun that is part of a sentence. These are called **relative clauses**.\n\nIn the sentence below, \"the corn that was ready\" is part of the predicate of the whole sentence. The relative clause \"that he had planted\" is used with the noun \"corn\" to tell which corn she picked.\n\n  * His wife picked **the corn** <u>that was ready</u>.\n\nIn the sentence below \"his mother, who was very annoyed\" is part of the predicate of the whole sentence. The relative clause \"who was very annoyed\" is used with the noun \"mother\" to tell how her mother felt when she did not get any corn.\n\n  * She did not give any corn to **her mother, <u>who was very annoyed</u>**.\n\n#### Translation Issues \n\n  * Languages have different orders for the parts of a sentence. \n  * Some languages do not have relative clauses, or they use them in a limited way.

The basic types of sentences are listed below with the functions they are mainly used for.\n\n  * **Statements**  - These are mainly used to give information. '_This is a fact._'\n  * **Questions**  - These are mainly used to ask for information. '_Do you know him?_'\n  * **Imperative Sentences**  - These are mainly used to express a desire or requirement that someone do something. '_Pick that up._'\n  * **Exclamations**  - These are mainly used to express a strong feeling. '_Ouch, that hurt!_'\n\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation Issue\n\n  * Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence has a particular function. \n  * Some languages use these sentence types for more than one function. \n  * A sentence in the Bible may have a certain sentence type and function, but some languages would not use that type for that function.\n\n####  Examples from the Bible\n\nThe examples below show each of these types used for their main functions.\n\n####  Statements\n\n>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1 ULB)\n\nStatements can also have other functions. (See [Statements - Other Uses](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_declarative.md))\n\n####  Questions \nThe speakers below used these questions to get information, and the people they were speaking to answered their questions.\n\n<blockquote>Jesus said to them, \"<u>Do you believe that I can do this?</u>\" They said to him, \"Yes, Lord.\" (Matthew 9:28 ULB) </blockquote>\n  \n<blockquote>The jailer...said, \"Sirs, <u>what must I do to be saved?</u>\" They said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your house.\" (Acts 16:29-31 ULB)</blockquote>\n\nQuestions can also have other functions. (See: [Rhetorical Question](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_rquestion.md))\n\n#### Imperative Sentences\n\nThere are different kinds of imperative sentences: commands, instructions, suggestions, invitations, requests, and wishes.\n\nWith a **command**, the speaker uses his authority and tells someone to do something.\n><u>Rise up</u>, Balak, and <u>hear</u>. <u>Listen</u> to me, you son of Zippor. (Numbers 23:18 ULB)\n\nWith an **instruction**, the speaker tells someone how to do something. \n>...but if you want to enter into life, <u>keep the **commandments**</u>. ... If you wish to be perfect, <u>go</u>, <u>sell</u> what you have, and <u>give</u> it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. (Matthew 19:17, 21 ULB)\n\nWith a **suggestion**, the speaker tells someone something to do that he thinks might help that person. In the example below, Paul was concerned about Timothy's health, so he suggested something Timothy could do in order to be well.\n\n><u>You should</u> no longer drink water. Instead, <u>you should</u> take a little wine for the stomach and your frequent sicknesses. ( 1 Timothy 5:23 ULB)\n\nSpeakers may intend to be part of the group that does what is suggested. In Genesis 11, the people were saying that it would be good for them all to make bricks together.   \n>They said to one another, \"Come, <u>let us</u> make bricks and bake them thoroughly.\" (Genesis 11:3 ULB)  \n\nWith an **invitation**, the speaker uses politeness or friendliness to suggest that someone do something if he wants. This is usually something that the speaker thinks the listener will enjoy.\n><u>Come</u> with us and we will do you good. (Numbers 10:29)\n\nWith a **request**, the speaker uses politeness to say that he wants someone to do something. This may include the word 'please' to make it clear that it is a request and not a command. This is usually something that would benefit the speaker.\n<blockquote><u>Give us</u> today our daily bread. The speaker is asking for something. (Matthew 6:11 ULB)  </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Please excuse me. (Luke 14:18 ULB)</blockquote>\n\nWith a **wish** a person expresses what they want to happen. In English they often start with the word \"may\" or \"let.\"\n\nIn Genesis 28, Isaac told Jacob what he wanted God to do for him.   \n><u>May God Almighty bless</u> you, make you fruitful and multiply you. (Genesis 28:3 ULB)    \n    \nIn Genesis 9, Noah said what he wanted to happen to Canaan.   \n><u>Cursed be</u> Canaan. <u>May he be</u> a servant to his brothers' servants. (Genesis 9:25 ULB)   \n   \nIn Genesis 21 Hagar expressed her strong desire not to see her son die, and then she moved away so that she would not see him die.   \n><u>Let me not look</u> upon the death of the child. (Genesis 21:16 ULB)   \n\nImperative sentences also have other functions. (See: [Imperatives - Other Uses](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_imperative.md))\n\n#### Exclamations\n\nExclamations express strong feeling. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end. \n>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)\n\nSee [Exclamations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_exclamations.md) for other ways that exclamations are shown and ways to translate them.\n\n### Translation Strategies \n\n1. Use your language's ways of showing that a sentence has a particular function.\n1. When a sentence in the Bible has a sentence type that your language would not use for the sentence's function, see the pages below for translation strategies.\n \n\n  * [Statements - Other Uses](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_declarative.md) \n  * [Rhetorical Question](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_rquestion.md) \n  * [Imperatives - Other Uses](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_imperative.md)\n  * [Exclamations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_exclamations.md)\n",

Speakers may do this in order to emphasize the idea that is the same in the two phrases. This is also called \"synonymous parallelism.\" \n\nNote: We use the term \"parallelism with the same meaning\" for long phrases or clauses that have the same meaning.  We use the term  [Doublet](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_doublet.md) for words or very short phrases that mean basically the same thing and are used together. \n>Yahweh <u>sees everything a person does</u> and <u>watches all the paths he takes</u>. (Proverbs 5:21 ULB) \n\nThe first underlined phrase and the second underlined phrase mean the same thing. There are three ideas that are the same between these to phrases. \"Sees\" corresponds to \"watches,\" \"everything … does\" corresponds to \"all the paths … takes,\" and \"a person\" corresponds to \"he.\" \n\nSynonymous parallelism in poetry has several effects: \n\n  * It shows that something is very important by saying it more than once and in more than one way. \n  * It helps the hearer to think more deeply about the idea by saying it in different ways. \n  * It makes the language more beautiful and above the ordinary way of speaking. \n\n#### Reason this is a Translation Issue\n\nIn some languages people do not expect someone to say the same thing twice, even in different ways. They expect that if there are two phrases or two sentences, they must have different meanings. So they  do not understand that the repetition of ideas serves to emphasize the idea. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path. (Psalm 119:105 ULB) \n\nBoth parts of the sentences are metaphors saying that God's word teaches people how to live. The words 'lamp' and 'light' are similar in meaning because they refer to light, and the words 'my feet' and 'my path' are related, because they refer to a person walking. \n>Praise Yahweh, all you nations; exalt him, all you peoples! (Psalm 117:1 ULB)   \n\nBoth parts of this verse tell people everywhere to praise Yahweh. The words 'Praise' and 'exalt' mean the same thing, 'Yahweh' and 'him' refer to the same person, and 'all you nations' and 'all you peoples' refer to the same people.  \n>For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, and he will fight in court against Israel. (Micah 6:2 ULB) \n\nThe two parts of this verse say that Yahweh has a serious disagreement with his people, Israel. These are not two different disagreements or two different groups of people. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf your language uses parallelism in the same way as the biblical languages, that is, to strengthen a single idea, then it would be appropriate to use it in your translation. But if your language does not use parallelism in this way, then consider using one of the following translation strategies.\n\n  1. Combine the ideas of both clauses into one. \n  1. If it appears that the clauses are used together to show that what they say is really true, you could include words that emphasize the truth such as \"truly\" or \"certainly.\" \n  1. If it appears that the clauses are used together to intensify an idea in them, you could use words like \"very,\" \"completely\" or \"all.\" \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Combine the ideas of both clauses into one. \n\n  * **Until now you have deceived me and told me lies.** (Judges 16:13, ULB) - Delilah expressed this idea twice to emphasize that she was very upset. \n      * \"Until now you have deceived me with your lies.\"\n\n  * **Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes.** (Proverbs 5:21 ULB) - The phrase \"all the paths he takes\" is a metaphor for \"all he does.\"\n      * \"Yahweh pays attention to everything a person does.\"\n\n  * **For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, and he will fight in court against Israel.** (Micah 6:2 ULB) - This parallelism describes one serious disagreement that Yahweh had with one group of people. If this is unclear, the phrases can be combined:\n      * \"For Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, Israel.\"\n\n2. If it appears that the clauses are used together to show that what they say is really true, you could include words that emphasize the truth such as \"truly\" or \"certainly.\" \n\n  * **Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes.** (Proverbs 5:21 ULB)\n      * \"Yahweh truly sees everything a person does.\"\n\n3. If it appears that the clauses are used together to intensify an idea in them, you could use words like \"very,\" \"completely\" or \"all.\" \n\n  * **you have deceived me and told me lies.** (Judges 16:13 ULB)\n      * \"All you have done is lie to me.\"\n\n  * **Yahweh sees everything a person does and watches all the paths he takes.** (Proverbs 5:21 ULB)\n      * \"Yahweh sees absolutely everything that a person does.\"\n\n\n",

The verbs in the examples below are underlined. \n\n  * John <u>ran</u>.  (\"Run\" is an action.)\n  * John <u>ate</u> a banana.  (\"Eat\" is an action.)\n  * John <u>saw</u> Mark. (\"See\" is an event.)\n  * John <u>died.</u>  (\"Die\" is an event.)\n  * John <u>is</u> tall.  (The phrase \"is tall\" describes John. The word \"is\" is a verb that links \"John\" with \"tall\".)\n  * John <u>looks</u> handsome. (The phrase \"is handsome\" describes John. The word \"looks\" here is a verb that links \"John\" with \"handsome.\")\n  * John <u>is</u> my brother. (The phrase \"is my brother\" identifies John.)\n\n### People or Things Associated with a Verb\n\nA verb usually says something about someone or something. All of the example sentences above say something about John. \"John\" is the **subject** of those sentences. In English the subject usually comes before the verb.\n\nSometimes there is another person or thing associated with the verb. In the examples below, the underlined one is the verb, and the phrase in bold print is the **object**. In English the object usually comes after the verb. \n\n  * He <u>ate</u> **lunch**.\n  * He <u>sang</u> **a song**.\n  * He <u>read</u> **a book**.\n  * He <u>saw</u> **the book**.\n\nSome verbs never have an object.\n\n  * The sun <u>rose</u> at six o'clock.\n  * John <u>slept</u> well.\n  * John <u>fell</u> yesterday.\n\nIn English, it is sometimes alright to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.\n\n  * He never <u>eats</u> at night. \n  * He  <u>sings</u> all the time.\n  * He <u>reads</u> well.\n  * He cannot <u>see</u>. \n\nIn some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. People who speak those languages might say the sentences above like this. \n\n  * He never <u>eats</u>  **food** at night. \n  * He  <u>sings</u> **songs** all the time.\n  * He <u>reads</u> **words** well.\n  * He cannot <u>see</u> **anything**.\n\n### Subject and Object Marking on Verbs   \n  \nIn some languages, the verb may be a little bit different depending on the persons or things associated with it. For example, English speakers sometimes put \"s\" at the end of the verb when the subject is just one person. In other languages marking on the verb may show whether the subject is \"I,\" \"you,\" or \"he\"; singular or plural; or male or female. \n\n* They __eat__ bananas every day. (The subject \"they\" is more than one person.) \n* John __eats__ bananas every day. (The subject \"John\" is one person.) \n\n### Time and Tense\n\nWhen we tell about an event, we usually tell whether it is in the past, the present, or the future. Sometimes we do this with words like \"yesterday,\" \"now,\" or \"tomorrow.\"\n\nIn some languages the verb may be a little bit different depending on the time associated with it. This kind of marking on a verb is called \"**tense**\". English speakers sometimes put \"ed\" at the end of the verb when the event happened in the past.\n\n  * Sometimes Mary <u>cooks</u> meat.\n  * Yesterday Mary <u>cooked</u> meat.  (She did this in the past.)\nIn some languages speakers might add a word to tell something about the time. English speakers use the word \"will\" when the verb refers to something in the future.\n  * Tomorrow Mary <u>will cook</u> meat. \n\n### Aspect\n\nWhen we tell about an event, we usually show whether or not we are thinking about how the event progressed over a period of time, and whether or not the event is still relevant when something else happens. This is \"**aspect**\". English speakers sometimes use the verbs \"is\" or \"has\" and adds \"s,\" \"ing,\" or \"ed\" to the end of the verb.\n\n  * Mary <u>cooks</u> meat every day. (This tell about something Mary often does.)\n  * Mary <u>is cooking</u> the meat. (This tells about something Mary is in the process of doing right now.)\n  * Mary <u>cooked</u> the meat, and John <u>came</u> home.  (This simply tells about things that Mary and John did.)\n  * While Mary <u>was cooking</u> the meat, John came home. (This tells about something Mary was in the process of doing when John came home)\n  * Mary <u>has cooked</u> the meat, and she wants us to come eat it. (This tells about something Mary did that is still relevant now.)\n  * Mary <u>had cooked</u> the meat by the time Mark came home. (This tells about something that Mary completed in the past before something else happened.)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These languages have a **singular** form of \"you\" for when the word \"you\" refers to just one person, and a **plural** form for when the word \"you\" refers to more than one person. However sometimes speakers in the Bible used the **singular** form of \"you\" even though they were speaking to a group of people.\n\n### Description\n\nSometimes people in the Bible used the singular form of \"you\" even though they were speaking to more than one person. This is not obvious when you read the Bible in English, because English does not have distinct forms for \"you\" singular and \"you\" plural. But you may see this if you read a Bible in a language that does have distinct forms. \n\n#### Reason this is a Translation Issue\n\n  * When a translator reads a Bible with \"you\" singular, he needs to know whether the speaker was speaking to one person or more than one.\n  * In some languages it might be confusing if a speaker uses the \"you\" singular when speaking to more than one person.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n><sup>1</sup>Take heed that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people to be seen by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. <sup>2</sup>So when <u>you</u> give alms, do not sound a trumpet before <u>yourself</u> as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward. (Matthew 6:1,2 ULB)\n\nJesus said this to a crowd. He used \"you\" plural in verse 1, and \"you\" singular in the first sentence of verse 2. Then in the last sentence he used the plural again. \n>God spoke all these words: \"I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You must have no other gods before me.\" (Exodus 20:1-3 ULB)\n\nGod said this to the people of Israel. He had taken them all out of Egypt and he wanted them all to obey him, but he used the the singular form of \"you\" here when speaking to them.\n\n#### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. If the singular form of \"you\" would be natural when speaking to a group, consider using it.\n    1. Whether you can use it may depend on who the speaker is and who his listeners are.\n    1. It may also depend on what the speaker is saying.\n  1. If the singular form of \"you\" would not be natural when speaking to a group, or if the readers would be confused by it, use the plural form of \"you.\"\n\n\n",

This page is primarily for people whose language makes this distinction.\n\n### Description\n\nSome languages make a distinction between the formal form of \"you\" and the informal form of \"you\".  This page is primarily for people whose language makes this distinction.\n\nIn some cultures people use the formal \"you\" when speaking to someone who is older or in authority, and they use the informal \"you\" when speaking to someone who is their own age or younger or who has less authority. In other cultures people use the formal \"you\" when speaking to strangers or people they do not know well, and the informal \"you\" when speaking with family members and close friends.\n\n#### Reasons this is a Translation Issue\n\n  * The Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. These languages do not have formal and informal forms of \"you\".\n  * English does not have formal and informal forms of \"you.\"\n  * Translators who use a source text in a language that has formal and informal forms of \"you\" will need to understand how those forms are used in that language.  The rules in that language may not be exactly the same as the rules in the translator's language.\n  * Translators will need to understand the relationship between two speakers in order to choose the appropriate form in their language.\n\n#### Translation Principles\n\n  * Understand the relationship between a speaker and whoever he is speaking to.\n  * Understand the speaker's attitude toward the person he is speaking to.\n  * Choose the form in your language that is appropriate for that relationship and attitude.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, \"Where are <u>you</u>?\" (Genesis 3:9 ULB)\n\nGod is in authority over the man so languages that have formal and informal forms of \"you\" would probably use the informal form here. \n>So, it seemed good to me also, having investigated everything accurately from the beginning, to write it down for  <u>you</u> in order, most excellent Theophilus. I want  <u>you</u> to know the certainty of the things that  <u>you </u> were taught. (Luke 1:3-4 ULB) \n\nLuke called Theophilus \"most excellent.\" This shows us that Theophilus was probably a high official who Luke was showing great respect to. Speakers of languages that have a formal form of  \"you\" would probably use it here.\n>Heavenly Father, sanctify <u>your</u> name. (Matthew 6:9 ULB) \n\nThis is part of a prayer that Jesus taught his disciples. Some cultures  would use the formal \"you\" because God is in authority. Other cultures would use the informal \"you\" because God is our Father. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nTranslators whose language has formal and informal forms of \"you\" will need to understand the relationship between two speakers in order to choose the appropriate form of \"you\" in their language.\n\nDeciding whether to Use the Formal or Informal \"You\"\n\n1. Pay attention to the relationships between the speakers.\n  * Is one speaker in authority over the other?\n  * Is one speaker older than the other?\n  * Are the speakers family members, relatives, friends, strangers, or enemies?\n1. If you have a Bible in a language that has formal and informal forms of \"you,\" see what forms it uses. Remember, though, that the rules in that language might be different than the rules in your language.\n\n### Translation Strategies Applied\n\nEnglish does not have formal and informal forms of \"you\", so we cannot show in English how to translate using formal and informal forms of \"you\".\n\n\n",

Whenever two or more translations of the Bible disagree about the meaning of a Bible passage, it is the original languages that have the final authority for deciding the meaning. Sometimes people are very loyal to certain Bible translations that they are used to reading, and might argue with other people who are loyal to a different Bible translation. But neither of those Bible translations are the highest authority, because they are only translations of the original. All translations are secondary in authority to the original languages. That is why we must always refer to the original biblical languages when deciding how to translate the Bible.\n\nSince not all translation teams have a member who can read the original languages of the Bible, it is not always possible to refer to the biblical languages when translating the Bible. Instead, the translation team has to rely on translations that they are able to read that have, in turn, been based on the biblical languages. Many of the translations in the Gateway Languages were translated from the biblical languages, including the ULB, but some are translations of translations. It is easy for errors to be introduced when a translation is two or three steps removed from the original. To help with this problem, the translation team can do three things:\n  1. The translation team must use translationNotes, translationWords, and any other translation helps they have to help them translate in the best way. These translation helps were written by Bible scholars who know the original biblical languages.\n  1. They should compare their translation with as many other reliable translations as they can, to make sure that it is communicating the same message as the others.\n  1. Someone who has studied the biblical languages should review the translation to make sure that it is accurate. This person could be a church leader, pastor, seminary professor, or Bible translation professional.\n\nSometimes Bible translations differ because some passages in the Bible are unclear or ambiguous in the original biblical languages. In that case, the translation team must choose between them based on what Bible scholars say in translationNotes, translationWords, the UDB, and other translation helps. \n\n\n\n",

You may have spelled a word differently when it was not necessary. Some words change in different situations, but some words can stay the same in every situation. Take note of these changes, so others can know what decisions you have made on the spelling of your language.\n  * Ask yourself if the way you wrote can be recognized easily by speakers of different dialects in your language community.

Especially notice the forms in the source text that communicate certain kinds of emotions and choose forms in the target language that communicate the same emotions. Examples of some of these forms follow.\n\n#### Idioms\n\nDetermine the meaning of difficult idioms, proverbs and figures of speech and translate them with meaningful expressions in your language.  Usually idioms cannot be translated literally into another language. The meaning of the idiom has to be expressed in a way that is natural in the other language.\n\nHere are three translations, all with the same meaning, of Acts 18:6:  \n\n* \"Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent\"  (RSV)\n* \"If you are lost, you yourselves must take the blame for it! I am not responsible\" (GNB)\n* \"If God punishes you, it is because of you, not me!\" (TFT)\n\nThese are all accusations of guilt. Some are using idioms with the word \"blood\" or \"lost,\" while the third is more direct using the word \"punishes.\" In order for your translation to be equal, it must also express an accusation in an emotional way, and may use an idiom, as long as both the form of the accusation and the idiom are appropriate for the target language and culture. \n\n#### Figures of Speech\n\nA figure of speech is a special way of saying something in order to catch the attention or express an emotion about what is said. Often the meaning of a figure of speech is different from the literal meaning of the words. The meaning is not intended to be taken literally. \n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* **I was shattered!**   The speaker was not literally broken, but he felt very bad.\n* **He closed his ears to what I was saying.**  Meaning, \"he chose to not listen to what I was saying.\"\n* **The wind moaned in the trees.** This means that the wind blowing through the trees sounded like a person moaning.\n* **The whole world came to the meeting.**  Everyone in the world did not attend the meeting. Most likely there were many people at the meeting.\n\nEach language has different figures of speech, make sure you can:\n\n* Recognize that a figure of speech is being used\n* Recognize the purpose of the figure of speech\n* Recognize the real meaning of the figure of speech\n\nIt is the **real meaning** that should be translated into your language, not the meaning of the individual words. Once you understand the real meaning, you can choose an expression in the target language that communicates that same meaning and emotion.\n\nFor more information, see the [Figures of Speech](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_intro.md) lesson as well.  \n\n#### Rhetorical Questions\n\n**[Rhetorical Questions](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_rquestion.md)** are another way that the speaker captures the attention of the reader. Rhetorical questions are a type of question that does not expect an answer or ask for information. They usually express some kind of emotion and can be intended as a rebuke, a warning, or to express surprise.\n\nSee, for example, Matthew 3:7: \"You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming?\" \n\nHere no answer is expected. The speaker is not asking for information, he is rebuking his hearers.  It does no good to warn these people of God's wrath, because they refuse the only way to escape it: to repent of their sins.  \n\nYou may need to restate this rhetorical question as a statement when you translate, if your language does not use rhetorical questions in this way.  But remember, be sure to keep the same purpose and meaning, and communicate the same emotion as the original rhetorical question had.\n\n**Remember:** Communicate the feelings and attitudes of the original text.  Translate them into forms that communicate in a similar way in your language. Consider how that meaning can best be **Accurately**, **Clearly**, **Equally**, and **Naturally Expressed** in the Target Language.\n",

      "file": "---\ntitle: Create Faithful Translations\nquestion: What are faithful translations? \nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: guidelines_faithful\ndependencies:  [\"guidelines_intro\", \"translation_guidelines\"]\nstatus: Draft\ntags: \nrecommended: [\"translate_discover\"]\noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/translation/faithful\ncredits: \n---\n### Faithful Translations\n\nTo make a translation that is faithful to the Bible, you must avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources.\n\nYour goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks that the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible or add any meaning to the message that is not there in the Bible passage.\n\nYou must also use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Read the definitions of the translationWords to make sure that you understand the meanings of these words. Translate so that these key terms have these same meanings, and do not translate them in different ways just to please your pastor, your village leaders, or yourself.\n\nAlways translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons:\n\n  1. You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and not know that there are other interpretations.\n    * Example: When you are translating the word \"baptize,\" you might want to translate it with a word that means \"sprinkle,\" because that is what your church does. But after reading translationWords, you learn that the word has a meaning in the range of \"plunge,\" \"dip,\" \"wash,\" or \"purify.\"\n  1. You might want to translate a Bible passage in a way that accords with your culture, rather than according to what it meant when it was written.\n    * Example: It is common in North American culture for women to speak and preach in churches. A translator from that culture might be tempted to translate the words of 1 Corinthians 14:34 in a way that is not as strict as the Apostle Paul wrote them: \"the women should keep silent in the churches.\" But a faithful translator will translate the meaning of the Bible passage just the way it is.\n  1. You might not like something that the Bible says, and be tempted to change it.\n    * Example: You might not like what Jesus says in John 6:53, \"Truly, truly, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.\" This may seem disgusting to you. But you must translate it faithfully, so that your people can read it and contemplate what Jesus meant by it.\n  1. You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says.\n    * Example: You might be tempted to translate God's words in Matthew 3:17, \"This is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him,\" with a word that does not mean \"son.\" But you must remember that you do not have the right to change the meaning of what the Bible says.\n  1. You might know something extra about the Bible passage that you are translating and want to add that to your translation.\n    * Example: When you are translating Mark 10:11, \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her,\" you might know that in Matthew 19:9 there is also the phrase, \"...except for sexual immorality....\" Even so, do not add this phrase into Mark 10:11, because that would not be translating faithfully. Also, do not add any of your own ideas or teachings from your church. Only translate the meaning that is there in the Bible passage.\n\nIn order to avoid these biases, especially the ones that you might not be aware of, you must study the translationNotes (see http://ufw.io/tn/), translationWords (see http://ufw.io/tw/) and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (see http://ufw.io/udb/), as well as any other translation helps that you have. That way you will know what the meaning of the Bible passage is, and you will be less likely to translate in a biased, unfaithful way.\n\nYou may also want to watch the video at http://ufw.io/guidelines_faithful.\n",

The Bible is a historical document. The events of the Bible happened in the way that the Bible describes at different times in history. Therefore, when you translate the Bible, you need to communicate that these events happened, and do not change any of the details of what happened. \n  1. The books of the Bible were written down at specific times in history for people of a certain culture. This means that some things in the Bible that were very clear to the original hearers and readers will not be clear to those who read the Bible in different times and in different cultures. This is because both the writer and the readers were familiar with many of the practices that the writer wrote about, and so the writer did not need to explain them. We, from other times and cultures, are not familiar with these things, and so we need someone to explain them to us. This kind of information is called \"implicit information.\" See [Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_explicit.md). \n\nSo as translators, we need to translate the historical details accurately, but also provide some explanation when we think that our readers will need it so that they can understand what the translation is about.\n\n  * For example, Genesis 12:16 refers to camels. For readers in parts of the world where this animal is unknown, it might be good to provide a description. The best way to do this is in a footnote, or in a glossary entry such as the one in translationWords.\nSome explanation can be included in the text, as long as it is brief and does not distract the reader from the main point of the text.\n  * For example, the New Testament writers often referred to events in the Old Testament, but without explaining what they were referring to. They knew that their readers were very familiar with the Old Testament, and did not need any explanation. But it is possible that readers from other times and places will need some explanation.\n\nLet us compare **1 Corinthians 10:1** from the ULB and UDB.\n\n>\"I want you to know, brothers and sisters that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea. \"  (ULB)\n\n>\"I want you to remember, brothers and sisters, that our Jewish ancestors were following God, who led them as a cloud during the day, as they passed through the Red Sea on dry land, long ago in the time of the Exodus.\"  (UDB)\n\nNotice that the UDB makes several points explicit: the 'fathers were all under the cloud' tells of the time that God led the Jewish ancestors as a cloud. The statement that 'our fathers passed through the sea' is also about the 'passing through the Red Sea in the time of the exodus.' The UDB translator decided to explicitly describe the historical events. This is a way to translate historical events that is more meaningful for those who have little knowledge of Old Testament history.\n\nInclude or refer to the needed implicit information intended by the original writer that will be necessary for your community to understand what is written.\n\nMaintain the historical accuracy of the message.  Avoid referring to items and events that were not present in the Bible times.  Do not make your translation sound like it is a modern day event.\n\nRemember:\n\n  * Keep true to the historical text. The original message, historical events, and cultural background information should all be the same as it was written in the source text. For example, the translation must not have the message rewritten so that events happened at a different place or time.\n  * Communicate clearly by expressing the message in such a way that people in the Target Language culture will be able to understand the meaning that the original author intended to communicate.\n  * Only provide additional information as needed to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the recipients of the original content.\n\n",

I am very pleased with him.\" (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)\n\nThe Bible shows that Jesus called God his Father.\n\n>Jesus said, \"I praise you <u>Father</u>, Lord of heaven and earth,... no one knows the <u>Son</u> except the <u>Father</u>, and no one knows the <u>Father</u> except the <u>Son</u>\" (Matthew 11:25-27 ULB) (See also: John 6:26-57 ULB)\n\nChristians have found that \"Father\" and \"Son\" are the ideas that most essentially describe the eternal relationship of the First and Second Persons of the Trinity to each other. The Bible indeed refers to them in various ways, but no other terms reflect the kind of eternal love and intimacy between these Persons, nor the interdependent eternal relationship between them.\n\nJesus referred to God in the following terms:\n> Baptize them into <u>the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit</u>. (Matthew 28:19 ULB)\n\nThe intimate, loving relationship between the Father and the Son is eternal.\n\n>no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son. (Luke 10:22 ULB)\n\n>Jesus said, \"Father, glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you... I glorified you on the earth,... Now Father, glorify me... with the glory that <u>I had with you before the world was created</u>.\" (John 17:1-5 ULB)\n\n>The Father <u>loves</u> the Son. (John 3:35-36; 5:19-20 ULB)\n\n>I <u>love</u> the Father, I do what the Father commands me, just as he gave me the commandment. (John 14:31 ULB)\n\n### Human Relationships\n\n**Human fathers and sons are not perfect, but the Bible still uses those terms for the Father and Son, who are perfect.**\n\nJust as today, human father-son relationships during Bible times were never as loving or perfect as the relationship between Jesus and his Father. But this does not mean that the translator should avoid the concepts of father and son. The scriptures use these terms to refer to God, the perfect Father and Son, as well as to sinful human fathers and sons. In referring to God as Father and Son, choose words in your language that are widely used and refer to a human \"father\" and \"son.\"\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. Think through all the possibilities that your language has to translate the words \"son\" and \"father.\" Determine which words in your language best represent the divine \"Son\" and \"Father.\"\n  1. If your language has more than one word for \"son,\" use the word that has the closest meaning to \"only son\" (or \"first son\" if necessary).\n  1. If your language has more than one word for \"father,\" use the word that has the closest meaning to \"birth father,\" rather than \"adoptive father.\"\n\nSee *God the Father* and *Son of God* pages in [translationWords](https://unfoldingword.org/en/?resource=translation-words) for help translating \"Father\" and \"Son.\"\n",

There are many things to think about when creating an alphabet, and creating a good one can be very difficult. If this seems to be too difficult, you could do an audio translation instead of a written one.\n\nThe goal of a good alphabet is to have one letter to represent each different sound of your language.\n\nIf a neighboring language already has an alphabet, and if that language has similar sounds to your language, it might work well to simply borrow their alphabet. If not, then the next best thing is to borrow the alphabet from the national language that you learned in school. However, it is likely that your language has sounds that the national language does not, and so it will be difficult to use this alphabet to represent all of the sounds of your language. In that case, it is good to think about each sound in your language. Write out the national language alphabet on a piece of paper from top to bottom. Then write a word from your language next to each letter that either starts with that sound or has that sound in it. Underline the letter that makes that sound in each of the words. There may be letters in the national alphabet that your language does not use. That is fine. Now think about the sounds from these words that you had a hard time writing, or that you could not find a letter for. If the sound is similar to a sound that you did find a letter for, then maybe you can modify that letter to represent the other sound. For example, if you have a sound represented by \"s\", and a similar sound that there was no letter for, you could add a mark to the letter for the similar sound, such as putting ' or ^ or ~ on top of it. If you find that there is a group of sounds that seem to all have the same kind of difference from the national language sounds, then it is good to modify that group of letters in the same way. \n\nOnce you have finished this exercise and cannot think of any more sounds in your language, try writing a story or write down something that happened recently. As you write, you will probably discover sounds that you had not thought of earlier. Continue to modify letters so that you can write these sounds. Add these sounds to the list you made earlier.\n\nTake your list of sounds to other speakers of your language who also read the national language and see what they think about it. Maybe they can suggest a different way to modify some letters that is simpler or easier to read. Also show these other people the story you wrote and teach them to read it by referring to your list of words and letter-sounds. If they can learn to read it easily, then your alphabet is good. If it is difficult, then there might be parts of the alphabet that still need work to be simpler, or there may be different sounds that are being represented by the same letter, or there may be some sounds that you still need to find letters for.\n\nIt is good to continue to work on this alphabet together with other speakers of your language who are good readers in the national language. You can discuss the different sounds and decide on the best way to represent them together. \n\nIf the national language uses a writing system other than the Roman alphabet, then think about the different marks that you could use to modify the symbols so that they can represent the sounds of your language. It is best if you can mark the symbols in ways that can be reproduced on a computer. You can experiment with the writing systems in a word processor or with the keyboards in translationKeyboard (http://ufw.io/tk/). If you need help creating a keyboard, send an email request to <help@door43.org>. When you use symbols that can be typed on a computer keyboard, then your translation can be stored, copied, and distributed electronically, and then people can get it for no cost and read it on tablets or cell phones.\n",

Most of these are based on the sizes of the hand and forearm.\n\n  * The **handbreadth** was the width of the palm of a man's hand. \n  * The **span** or handspan was the width of a man's hand with the fingers spread out.\n  * The **cubit**  was the length of a man's forearm, from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger.\n  * The **\"long\" cubit**  is used only in Ezekiel 40-48. It is the length of a normal cubit plus a span.\n  * The **stadium**  (plural, **stadia**) referred to a certain footrace that was about 185 meters in length. Some older English versions translated this word as \"furlong\", which referred to the average length of a plowed field.\n\nThe metric values in the table below are close but not exactly equal to the biblical measures. The biblical measures probably differed in exact length from time to time and place to place. The equivalents below are an attempt to give an average measurement. \n\n| Original Measure | Centimeters | Meters  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| handbreadth     | 8 centimeters    | .08 meters     |\n| span      | 23 centimeters      | .23 meters      |\n| cubit    | 46 centimeters    | .46 meters    |\n| \"long\" cubit    | 54 centimeters    | .54 meters    |\n| stadia     | -    | 185 meters    |\n\n\n#### Translation Principles\n\n  1. The people in the Bible did not use modern measures such as meters, liters, and kilograms. Using the original measures can help readers know that the Bible really was written long ago in a time when people used those measures.\n  1. Using modern measures can help readers understand the text more easily.\n  1. Whatever measure you use, it would be good, if possible, to tell about the other kind of measure in the text or a footnote.\n  1. If you do not use the Biblical measures, try not to give the readers the idea that the measurements are exact.  For example, if you translate one cubit as \".46 meters\" or even as \"46 centimeters,\" readers might think that the measurement is exact. It would be better to say \"half a meter,\" \"45 centimeters,\" or \"50 centimeters.\"\n  1. Sometimes it can be helpful to use the word \"about\" to show that a measurement is not exact. For example, Luke 24:13 says that Emmaus was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. This can be translated as \"about ten kilometers\" from Jerusalem.\n  1. When God tells people how long something should be, and when people make things according to those lengths, do not use \"about\" in the translation. Otherwise it will give the impression that God did not care exactly how long something should be.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. Use the measurements from the ULB. These are the same kinds of measurements that the original writers used. Spell them in a way that is similar to the way they sound or are spelled in the ULB. (See: [Copy or Borrow Words](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_transliterate.md))\n  1. Use the metric measurements given in the UDB. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system.\n  1. Use measurements that are already used in your language. In order to do this you would need to know how your measurements relate to the metric system and figure out each measurement.\n  1. Use the measurements from the ULB and include measurements that your people know in the text or a note. \n  1. Use measurements that your people know, and include the measurements from the ULB in the text or in a note. \n\n### Translation Strategies Applied\n\nThe strategies are all applied to Exodus 25:10 below.\n\n  * **They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be two and a half cubits; its width will be one cubit and a half; and its height will be one cubit and a half.** (Exodus 25:10 ULB)\n\n1. Use the measurements given in the ULB. These are the same kinds of measurements that the original writers used. Spell them in a way that is similar to the way they sound or are spelled in the ULB. (See: [Copy or Borrow Words](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_transliterate.md))\n  * \"They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be <u>two and a half kubits</u>; its width will be <u>one kubit and a half</u>; and its height will be <u>one kubit and a half</u>.\"\n\n2.  Use the metric measurements given in the UDB. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system.\n   * \"They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be <u>one meter</u>; its width will be <u>0.7 meter</u>; and its height will be <u>0.7 meter</u>.\" \n\n3.  Use measurements that are already used in your language. In order to do this you would need to know how your measurements relate to the metric system and figure out each measurement. For example, if you measure things using the standard foot length, you could translate it as below.\n  * \"They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be<u> 3 3/4 feet</u>; its width will be <u>2 1/4 feet</u>; and its height will be <u>2 1/4 feet</u>. \n\n4. Use the measurements from the ULB and include measurements that your people know in the text or a note. The following shows both measurements in the text.\n  * \"They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be <u>two and a half cubits (one meter)</u>; its width will be <u>one cubit and a half (0.7 meter)</u>; and its height will be <u>one cubit and a half (0.7 meter)</u>.\"\n\n5. Use measurements that your people know, and include the measurements from the ULB in the text or in  a note. The following shows the ULB measurements in notes.\n  * \"They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be <u>one meter</u><sup>1</sup>; its width will be <u>0.7 meter</u> <sup>2</sup>; and its height will be <u>0.7 meter</u>.\" The footnotes would look like:\n    * <sup>[1]</sup> one meter two and a half cubits\n    * <sup>[2]</sup>  one cubit and a half\n\n\n",

It has two main parts. The first part was written first and is called the Old Testament. The second part was written later and is called the New Testament. The Old Testament has 39 books and the New Testament has 27 books. (Some of the books in the New Testament are letters to people.)\n\nEach book is divided up into chapters. Most books have more than one chapter, but Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude each have only one chapter. All the chapters are divided up into verses. \n\nWhen we want to refer to a verse, we first write the name of the book, then the chapter, and then the verse. For example \"John 3:16\" means John, chapter 3, verse 16.\n\nWhen we refer to two or more verses that are next to each other, we put a line between them. \"John 3:16-18\" means John, chapter 3, verses 16, 17, and 18.\n\nWhen we refer to verses that are not next to each other, we use commas to separate them. \"John 3:2, 6, 9\" means John chapter 3, verses 2, 6, and 9.\n\nIn translationAcademy we tell where portions of scripture come from.

This includes metaphors, similes, metonymies, and cultural models. Most of these things in a language come from broad patterns of pairings between images and ideas, but some do not. These pages on Biblical Imagery tell about patterns of imagery in the Bible.\n\nThe patterns of pairings found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere they see the same patterns.\n\n### Common Patterns in Metaphors and Similes \n\nA **metaphor** occurs when someone speaks of one thing as if it were a different thing. The speaker does this in order to effectively describe the first thing. For example, in \"My love is a red, red rose,\" the speaker is describing the woman he loves as beautiful and delicate. \n\nA **simile** is like a metaphor, except that it uses words such as \"like\" or \"as\" as a signal to the audience that it is a figure of speech.\n\nSee: [Biblical Imagery - Common Patterns](translate_bita_part1.md) for links to pages showing common patterns of pairings between ideas in metaphors and similes.\n\n### Common Metonymies \n\nIn metonymy, a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. \n\nSee [Biblical Imagery - Common Metonymies](translate_bita_part2.md) for a list of some common metonymies in the Bible.\n\n\n### Cultural Models \nCultural models are mental pictures of parts of life or behavior. These pictures help us imagine and talk about these things. For example, Americans often think of marriage and friendship as if they were machines. Americans might say \"His marriage is breaking down\" or \"Their friendship is going full speed ahead.\" \n\nThe Bible often speak of God as if he were a shepherd and his people were sheep. This is a cultural model.\n\n<blockquote>Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing. (Psalm 23:1 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n>He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock. (Psalm 78:52 ULB)\n\n\nSome of the cultural models in the Bible were used much by the cultures in the Ancient Near East, and not only by the Israelites. \n\nSee: [Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models](translate_bita_part3.md) for a list of cultural models in the Bible.\n",

(Proverbs 6:5 ULB)\n\nA fowler is a person who catches birds, and a snare is a small trap.\n\n>We have escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowlers;  \n>the snare has been broken, and we have escaped. (Psalm 124:7 ULB)\n\n#### BIRDS THAT EAT MEAT represent enemies who attack swiftly\n\nIn Habakuk  and Hosea, Israel's enemies who would come and attack them were compared to an eagle. \n<blockquote> and their horsemen come from a great distance—they fly like an eagle hurrying to eat! (Habakkuk 1:8 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n>An eagle is coming over the house of me, Yahweh.  \n> ... Israel has rejected what is good,  \n>and the enemy will pursue him.

(Psalms 17:8-9 ULB)\n\n\n>Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me,  \n>for I take refuge in you until these troubles are over.  \n>I stay under your wings for protection until this destruction is over.  (Psalm 57:1 ULB)\n\n#### DANGEROUS ANIMALS represent dangerous people \n\nIn Psalms, David referred to his enemies as lions.\n>My life is among lions;  \n>I am among those who are ready to devour me.  \n>I am among people whose teeth are spears and arrows,  \n>and whose tongues are sharp swords.  \n>Be exalted, God, above the heavens (Psalm 57:4 ULB)\n\nPeter called the devil a roaring lion.\n>Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary—the devil—like a roaring lion is stalking around, looking for someone to devour. (1 Peter 5:8 ULB)\n\nIn Matthew, Jesus called false prophets wolves because of the harm they did to people by their lies.\n>Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep's clothing, but are truly ravenous wolves. (Matthew 7:15 ULB)\n\nIn Matthew, John the Baptist called the religious leaders poisonous snakes because of the harm they did by teaching lies.\n>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism, he said to them, \"You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming? (Matthew 3:7 ULB)\n\n#### EAGLES represent strength  \n\n> He satisfies your life with good things  \n> so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.

He who was sown on the rocky ground is he who hears the word and receives it with joy immediately....He who was sown among the thorn plants, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word.... He who was sown on the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it. (Matthew 13:20-23)</blockquote>\n\n> Break up your unplowed ground,\n> for it is time to seek Yahweh.... (Hosea 10:12)\n\n#### SOWING represents actions or attitudes, and REAPING represents judgment or reward \n> Based on what I have observed, those who plow iniquity  \n> and sow trouble reap the same. (Job 4:8 ULB)\n\n> Do not be deceived. God is not mocked. Whatever a man plants, that is what he will also harvest. For he who sows seed to his own sinful nature will harvest destruction, but he who sows seed to the Spirit, will harvest eternal life from the Spirit. (Galatians 6:7-8 ULB)\n\n#### THRESHING and WINNOWING represent the separation of evil people from good people \nAfter farmers harvest wheat and other types of grain, they bring them to a _threshing floor_, a flat place with hard ground, and have oxen pull heavy wheeled carts or sleds without wheels over the grain to _thresh_ it, to separate the usable grains from the useless chaff. Then they take large forks and _winnow_ the threshed grain by throwing it up in the air so the wind can carry off the chaff while the grains fall back to the threshing floor, where they can be gathered and used for food. (See *thresh* and *winnow* pages in [translationWords](https://unfoldingword.org/en/?resource=translation-words) for help translating \"thresh\" and \"winnow.\")\n\n> So I will winnow them with a pitchfork at the gates of the land. I will bereave them. I will destroy my people since they will not turn from their ways. (Jeremiah 15:7 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote> His winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with fire that can never be put out. (Luke 3:17 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n#### GRAFTING represents God's allowing the Gentiles to become his people \n> For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive tree, how much more will these Jews, who are the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree? For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of this mystery, in order that you will not be wise in your own thinking. This mystery is that a partial hardening has occurred in Israel, until the completion of the Gentiles come in. (Romans 11:24-25 ULB)\n\n#### RAIN represents God's gifts to his people \n> ...he comes and rains righteousness on you. (Hosea 10:12)\n \n \n<blockquote>For the land that has received the rain that often falls on it, and that produces a crop useful for those who worked the land, receives a blessing from God. But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. Its end comes in burning. (Hebrews 6:7-8)</blockquote>\n\n\n> Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord, like the farmer awaits the valuable harvest of the earth, waiting patiently for it, until the early and late rains fall. (James 5:7)\n\n",

(Leviticus 16:18-19 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>This is because on this day atonement will be made for you, to <u>cleanse</u> you from all your sins so you will be clean before Yahweh.  (Leviticus 16:30 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n#### UNCLEANLINESS represents not being acceptable for God's purposes \n\n>You may eat any animal that has a split hoof and that also chews the cud. However, some animals either chew the cud or have a split hoof, and <u>you must not eat them</u>, animals such as the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have a split hoof. So the camel is <u>unclean</u> for you. (Leviticus 11:3-4 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>And if any of them dies and falls on anything, that thing will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, leather, or sackcloth.

(Leviticus 11:32 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n\n#### MAKING SOMETHING UNCLEAN represents making it unacceptable for God's purposes. \n\n> Or if anyone touches anything God has designated as unclean, whether it be the carcass of an unclean wild animal or the carcass of any livestock that has died, or creeping animal, even if the person did not intend to touch it, he is unclean and guilty.

Everyone who defiles it must surely <u>be put to death</u>. Whoever works on the Sabbath, that person must surely <u>be cut off from his people</u>. (Exodus 31:14-15 ULB\n\n\n<blockquote>Whoever does not humble himself on that day must be <u>cut off from his people</u>. Whoever does any work on that day, <u>I, Yahweh, will destroy him</u> from among his people. (Leviticus 23:29-30 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n\n>But he was cut off from the land of the living.  (Isaiah 53:8 ULB)\n\n\n#### COMING AND STANDING BEFORE SOMEONE represents serving him \n\n<blockquote>How blessed are your people, and how blessed are your servants who constantly stand before you, because they hear your wisdom.

So too, when God judges people, they become weak and stagger. So the idea of wine is used to represent God's judgment.\n\n>You have shown your people severe things;  \n>you have made us drink the wine of staggering. (Psalm 60:3 ULB)\n\n\n>But God is the judge;  \n>he brings one down and raises up another.  \n>For Yahweh holds a cup in his hand of foaming wine,  \n>which is mixed with spices, and pours it out.  \n>Surely all the wicked of the earth will drink it to the last drop.

Numbers 24:8 ULB)\n\n\nAnother word for \"eat up\" is devour.\n>Therefore as <u>the tongue of fire devours stubble</u>, and as the dry grass goes down in flame,  \n>so their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust, (Isaiah 5:24 ULB)\n\n\n>Therefore Yahweh will raise up against him, Rezin, his adversary, and will stir up his enemies,  \n>the Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west.  \n><u>They will devour Israel with open mouth</u>.

They provoked Yahweh to anger because they broke away from Yahweh and worshiped Baal and the Ashtoreths.\n\n\n<blockquote>For Solomon followed Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and <u>he followed Milcom, the disgusting idol of the Ammonites</u>.   (1 Kings 11:5 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>Not one of them who despised me will see it, except for my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit. <u>He has followed me fully</u>; I will bring him into the land which he went to examine.

Neither does what is perishable inherit what is imperishable. (1 Corinthians 15:50 ULB) \n\nPeople cannot receive the kingdom of God in its complete form as a permanent possession while they are still in their mortal bodies.\n\nAn **INHERITANCE** is something that someone permanently possesses\n\n>You will bring them and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance.

(Ephesians 1:18 ULB) \n\nThe wonderful things that God will give all who are set apart for him is viewed as their permanent possession.\n\nAn **HEIR** is someone who permanently possesses something\n\n>For it was not through the law that the promise was given to Abraham and to his descendants, this promise that they would be heirs of the world. (Romans 4:13 ULB)\n\nThe promise was that Abraham and his descendants would permanently possess the entire world.\n\n>God has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things.

The word in all capital letters represents an idea. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.\n\n#### The BODY represents a group of people \n> Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. (1 Corinthians 12:27 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>Rather we will speak the truth in love and grow up in all ways into him who is the head, Christ. Christ joins the whole body of believers together—it is held together by every supporting ligament so that the whole body grows and builds itself up in love. (Ephesians 4:15-16 ULB) </blockquote>\n\nIn these verses, the body of Christ represents the group of people who follow Christ.\n\n\n#### The FACE represents someone's presence \n\n>Do you not fear me—this is Yahweh's declaration—or tremble __before my face__? (Jeremiah 5:22 ULB)\n\nTo be before someone's face is to be in their presence, that is, to be with them.\n\n#### The FACE represents someone's attention  \n\n> Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, or who __puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face__, and who then comes to a prophet—I, Yahweh, will answer him according to the number of his idols.

(Psalm 44:24 ULB)\n\nTo hide one's face from someone is to ignore him.\n\n#### The FACE represents surface \n\n>The famine was over all the face of the whole land. (Genesis 41:56 ULB)\n\n<blockquote> He encloses the face of the moon and spreads his clouds on it. (Job 26:9 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n\n#### The HAND represents a person's agency or power  \n\n> Yahweh has burst through my enemies by my hand like a bursting flood of water. (1 Chronicles 14:11 ULB) \n\n\"Yahweh has burst through my enemies by my hand\" means \"Yahweh has used me to burst through my enemies.\"\n\n>Your hand will seize all your enemies; your right hand will seize those who hate you. (Psalm 21:8 ULB) \n\n\"Your hand will seize all your enemies\" means \"By your power you will seize all your enemies.\"\n\n>Look, Yahweh's hand is not so short that it cannot save. (Isaiah 59:1 ULB) \n\n\"His hand is not short\" means that he is not weak.\n\n#### The HEAD represents the ruler, the one who has authority over others\n\n>God has subjected all things under Christ's feet and has made him the head over all things in the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all things in all ways.

(Ephesian 5:22-23 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n#### A MASTER represents anything that motivates someone to act \n\n>No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. (Matthew 6:24 ULB)\n\nTo serve God is to be motivated by God. To serve money is to be motivated by money.\n\n#### A NAME represents the person who has that name \n\n>May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne.\" 1 Kings 1:47 (ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote> See, I have sworn by my great name—says Yahweh. My name will no longer be called upon by the mouths of any of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt….\"  (Jeremiah 44:26 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n\nIf someone's name is great, it means that he is great. \n\n>Listen now to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight to honor your name…. Nehemiah 1:11 (ULB)\n\n\nTo honor someone's name is to honor him.\n\n#### A NAME represents the fame or reputation of a person \n\n>You must no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and your idols. Ezekiel 20:39 (ULB)\n\n\nTo profane God's name is to profane his reputation, that is, to profane how people think about him.\n\n>For I will make my great name holy, which you have profaned among the nations…. Ezekiel 36:23 (ULB)\n\n\nTo make God's name holy is to cause people to to see that God is holy.\n\n>Your servants have come here from a land very far away, because of the name of Yahweh your God. We have heard a report about him and about everything that he did in Egypt (Joshua 9:9 ULB)\n\n\nThe fact that the men said they heard a report about Yahweh shows that \"because of the name of Yahweh\" means because of Yahweh's reputation.\n\n#### The NOSE represents anger \n\n>Then…the foundations of the world were exposed at your battle cry, Yahweh—at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. (Psalms 18:15 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>By the blast of your nostrils the waters were piled up….  (Exodus 15:8 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>Smoke went up from out of his nostrils, and blazing fire came out of his mouth…. (2 Samuel 22:9 ULB) \n\n\n<blockquote>…This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration: 'My fury will arise in my nostrils!'  (Ezekiel 38:18 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\nA blast of air or smoke coming from someone's nose shows his great anger.\n\n#### RAISED EYES represents arrogance \n\n> but you bring down those with proud, uplifted eyes!  (Psalm 18:27 ULB)\n\n\nUplifted eyes show that a person is proud.\n\n> God humbles a proud man, and he saves the one with lowered eyes. (Job 22:29 ULB)\n\n\nLowered eyes show that a person is humble.\n\n#### The SON OF SOMETHING shares its qualities \n\n> no son of wickedness will oppress him. (Psalm 89:22b ULB)\n\n\nA son of wickedness is a wicked person.\n\n> May the groans of the prisoners come before you;  \n> with the greatness of your power keep the __children of death__ alive. (Psalm 79:11 ULB)\n\n\nChildren of death here are people that others plan to kill.\n\n>We all were once among these unbelievers and acted according to the evil desires of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and of the mind, and we were by nature __children of wrath__ like the others. (Ephesians 2:3 ULB)\n\n\nChildren of wrath here are people with whom God is very angry. \n\n\n### Translation Strategies  \nSee the Translations Strategies on [Biblical Imagery - Common Patterns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_bita_part1.md). \n",

      "file": "---\ntitle: Biblical Imagery - Common Patterns\nquestion: In the Bible, what ideas are often used to represent other ideas?\nmanual: translate\nvolume: 2\nslug: bita_part1\ndependencies:  [\"translate_bita\", \"figs_metaphor\", \"figs_simile\"]\nstatus:  finished\ntags: \nrecommended: \noriginal_url: https://door43.org/en/ta/workbench/translate/biblicalimageryta_part1\ncredits: \n---\n\n_This page discusses ideas that are paired together in limited ways. For a discussion of more complex pairings, see [Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models](translate_bita_part3.md)._\n\n### Description \n\nIn all languages, most **metaphors** come from broad patterns of pairings of ideas in which one idea represents another. For example, some languages have the pattern of pairing __height__ with \"much\" and pairing __being low__ with  \"not much,\" so that __height__ represents \"much\" and __being low__ represents \"not much.\" This could be because when there is a lot of something in a pile, that pile will be high. So also if something costs a lot money, in some languages people would say that the price is __high__, or if a city has more people in it than it used to have, we might say that its number of people has gone __up__. Likewise if someone gets thinner and loses weight, we would say that their weight has gone __down__. \n\nThe patterns found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.\n\nFor example, one pattern of pairings in the Bible is of <u>walking</u> with   \"behaving\" and <u>a path</u> with a kind of behavior. In Psalm 1:1 the walking in the advice of the wicked represents doing what wicked people say to do.\n\n>Blessed is the man who does not <u>walk</u> in the advice of the wicked (Psalm 1:1)\n\n\nThis pattern is also seen in Psalm 119:32 where running in the path of God's commands represents doing what God commands. Since running is more intense than walking, the idea of running here might give the idea of doing this whole-heartedly.\n\n> I will <u>run in the path</u> of your commandments. (Psalm 119:32 ULB)\n\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation Issue \n\nThese patterns present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:\n\n(1) When looking at particular metaphors in the Bible, it is not always obvious what two ideas are paired with each other. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression //It is God who puts strength on me like a belt// (Psalm 18:32 ULB) is based on the pairing of clothing with moral quality. In this case, the image of a belt represents strength. (See: \"Clothing represents a moral quality\" in [Biblical Imagery - Man-made Objects](translate_bita_manmade.md))\n\n(2) When looking at a particular expression, the translator needs to know whether or not it represents something. This can only be done by considering the surrounding text. The surrounding text shows us for example, whether \"lamp\" refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light or whether \"lamp\" is an image  that represents life. (See: \"FIRE or LAMP represents life\" in [Biblical Imagery - Natural Phenomena](translate_bita_phenom.md)). \n\nIn 1 Kings 7:50, a lamp trimmer is a tool for trimming the wick on an ordinary lamp. In 2 Samuel 21:17 the lamp of Israel represents King David's life. When his men were concerned that he might \"put out the lamp of Israel\" they were concerned that he might be killed.\n\n<blockquote>The cups, <u>lamp</u> trimmers, basins, spoons, and incense burners were all made of pure gold.  (1 Kings 7:50)</blockquote>\n\n\n>Ishbibenob...intended to kill David. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah rescued David, attacked the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, \"You must not go to battle anymore with us, so that you do not put out the <u>lamp</u> of Israel.\" (2 Samuel 21:16-17)\n\n\n(3) Expressions that are based on these pairings of ideas frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies and cultural models.  (See: [Biblical Imagery - Common Metonymies](translate_bita_part2.md) and [Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models](translate_bita_part3.md).) For example, in 2 Samuel 14:7 below, \"the burning coal\" is an image for the life of the son, who represents what will cause people to remember his father. So there are two patterns of pairings here: the pairing of the burning coal with the life of the son, and the pairing of the son with the memory of his father.\n\n>They say, 'Hand over the man who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed.' And so they would also destroy the heir. Thus they will put out <u>the burning coal</u> that I have left, and they will leave for <u>my husband neither name nor descendant</u> on the surface of the earth. (2 Samuel 14:7 ULB)\n\n\n#### Links to Lists of Images in the Bible \n\nThe following pages have lists of some of the ideas that represent others in the Bible, together with examples from the Bible. They are organized according to the kinds of image:\n\nA. [Biblical Imagery - Body Parts and Human Qualities](translate_bita_humanqualities.md)\n\nB.

The word in all capital letters represents an idea. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.\n\n#### A CUP or bowl represents what is in it \n\n> my cup runs over.  (Psalm 23:5 ULB)\n\nThere is so much in the cup that it runs over the top of the cup.\n\n> For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.  (1 Corinthians 11:26 ULB)\n\n\nPeople do not drink cups. They drink what is in the cup.\n\n#### The MOUTH represents speech or words\n\n>A fool's mouth is his ruin.  (Proverbs 18:7 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>Oh, how I would encourage you with my mouth!  (Job 16:5 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n>I heard you when you boasted against me with your mouth; you said many things against me. I heard them. (Ezekiel 35:13 ULB)\n\n\nIn these examples the mouth refers to what a person says.\n\n#### The MEMORY OF A PERSON represents his descendants\n\nThe memory of a person represents his descendants, because they are the ones who should remember and honor him. When the Bible says that someone's memory dies, it means that either he will not have any descendants, or his descendants will all die.\n\n>You terrified the nations with your battle cry;  \n>you have destroyed the wicked;  \n>you have blotted out <u>their memory</u> forever.  \n>The enemy crumbled like ruins  \n>when you overthrew their cities.  \n>All <u>remembrance of them</u> has perished. (Psalm 9:5-6 ULB)\n\n<blockquote> <u>His memory</u> will perish from the earth (Job 18:17 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n>Yahweh is against evildoers,  \n>in order to wipe out <u>their memory</u> from the earth. (Psalm 34:16 ULB)\n\n\n#### ONE PERSON represents many people \n\n>For the wicked person boasts of his deepest desires;  \n>he blesses the greedy and insults Yahweh. (Psalm 10:3 ULB)\n\nThis does not refer to a particular wicked person, but to wicked people in general.\n\n#### A PERSON'S NAME represents his descendants \n\n>Gad—raiders will attack him, but he will attack them at their heels.  \n>Asher's food will be rich, and he will provide royal delicacies.  \n>Naphtali is a doe let loose; he will have beautiful fawns. (Genesis 49:19-21 ULB)\n\n\nThe names Gad, Asher, and Naphtali refer not only to those men, but to their descendants.\n\n#### A PERSON represents himself and the people with him \n\n>It came about that when Abram entered into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. (Genesis 12:14 ULB)\n\nHere when it says \"Abram\" it represents Abram and all the people traveling with him. The focus was on Abram.   \n\n#### PIERCING represents killing \n\n> His hand pierced the fleeing serpent. (Job 26:13 ULB)\n\nThis means that he killed the serpent.\n\n> Look, he is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, including those who pierced him. (Revelation 1:7 ULB)\n\n\"Those who pierced him\" refers to those who killed Jesus.\n\n#### SINS represent punishment \n\n>Yahweh has placed on him the iniquity of us all   (Isaiah 53:6 ULB) \n\nThis means that Yahweh placed on him the punishment that should have gone to all of us.\n",

These pictures help us imagine and talk about these topics. For example, Americans often think of marriage and friendship as if they were machines. Americans might say \"His marriage is breaking down\" or \"Their friendship is going full speed ahead.\" In this example, human relationships are modeled as a MACHINE.\n\nSome cultural models, or mental pictures, found in the Bible are listed below. First there are models for God, then models for humans, things, and experiences. Each heading has the model written in capital letters. That word or phrase does not necessarily appear in every verse, but the idea does.\n\n#### God is modeled as a HUMAN BEING\n\nAlthough the Bible explicitly denies that God is a human being, he is often spoken of as doing things that humans do. But God is not human, so when the Bible say that God speaks, we should not think that he has vocal chords that vibrate. And when it says something about him doing something with his hand, we should not think that he has a physical hand.  \n\n>If we hear <u>the voice of Yahweh our God</u> any longer, we will die. (Deuteronomy 5:25 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>I have been strengthened by <u>the hand of Yahweh my God</u> (Ezra 7:28 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n><u>The hand of God</u> also came on Judah, to give them one heart to carry out the command of the king and leaders by the word of Yahweh (2 Chronicles 30:12 ULB)\n\nThe word \"hand\" here is a metonym that refers to God's power. (See: [Metonymy](figs_metonymy.md))\n\n#### God is modeled as a KING \n\n> For God is the <u>King</u> over all the earth; (Psalm 47:7 ULB)\n\n>For the <u>kingdom</u> is Yahweh's;  \n>he is the <u>ruler</u> over the nations. (Psalm 22:28 ULB)\n\n>Your <u>throne</u>, God, is forever and ever;  \n>a <u>scepter</u> of justice is the scepter of your <u>kingdom</u>. (Psalm 45:6 ULB)\n\n>This is what Yahweh says,  \n>\"Heaven is my <u>throne</u>, and the earth is my <u>footstool</u>. (Isaiah 66:1 ULB)\n\n>God <u>reigns</u> over the nations;  \n>God sits on his holy <u>throne</u>.  \n>The <u>princes</u> of the peoples have gathered together  \n>to the people of the God of Abraham;  \n>for the <u>shields</u> of the earth belong to God;  \n>he is greatly exalted.  (Psalm 47:8-9 ULB)\n\n#### God is modeled as a SHEPHERD and his people are models as SHEEP\n\n> Yahweh is <u>my shepherd</u>; I will lack nothing. (Psalm 23:1 ULB)\n\nHis people are sheep.\n> For he is our God, and we are the people of <u>his pasture</u> and the <u>sheep of his hand</u>. (Psalm 95:7 ULB)\n\nHe leads his people like sheep.\n>He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock. (Psalm 78:52 ULB)\n\nHe is willing to die in order to save his sheep.\n> I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me. The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and <u>I lay down my life for the sheep</u>. I have other sheep that are not of this fold. Those, also, I must bring, and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd. (John 10:14-15 ULB)\n\n#### God is modeled as a WARRIOR\n\n>Yahweh is a <u>warrior</u>; (Exodus 15:3 ULB)\n\n> Yahweh will go out as a warrior; he will proceed as a man of war. He will stir up his zeal.  \n> He will shout, yes, he will roar his battle cries; he will show his enemies his power. (Isaiah 42:13 ULB)\n\n>Your right hand, Yahweh, is <u>glorious in power</u>;  \n>your right hand, Yahweh, <u>has shattered the enemy</u>. (Exodus 15:6 ULB\n\n>But <u>God will shoot them</u>;  \n>suddenly they will be wounded with his arrows. (Psalm 65:7 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>For you will turn them back; <u>you will draw your bow</u> before them. (Psalm 21:12 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n#### A leader is modeled as a SHEPHERD and those he leads are modeled as SHEEP\n\n>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, \"Look...when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh said to you, 'You will <u>shepherd</u> my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel.' \" (2 Samuel 5:1-2 ULB)\n\n<blockquote> \"Woe to the <u>shepherds</u> who destroy and scatter the <u>sheep</u> of my <u>pasture</u>—this is Yahweh's declaration.\"  (Jeremiah 23:1  ULB)</blockquote>\n\n>Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the <u>flock</u> of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to <u>shepherd</u> the assembly of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood. 29I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the <u>flock</u>. I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them. (Acts 20:28-30 ULB)\n\n#### The eye is modeled as a LAMP\n\n\nVariations of this model and the model of the EVIL EYE are found in many parts of the world. In most of the cultures represented in the Bible, these models included the following elements:\n\nPeople see objects, not because of light around the object, but because of light that shines from their eyes onto those objects. \n>The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. (Matthew 6:22 ULB)\n\nThis light shining from the eyes carries with itself the viewer's character. \n>The appetite of the wicked craves evil; his neighbor sees no kindness in his eyes.  (Proverbs 21:10 ULB)\n\n#### Envy and cursing are modeled as looking with an EVIL EYE at someone, and favor is modeled as looking with a GOOD EYE at someone\n\nThe primary emotion of a person with the evil eye is envy. The Greek word translated as \"envy\" in Mark 7 is \"eye,\" which refers here to an evil eye.\n\n>He said, \"It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him. For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts…, envy  …. (Mark 7:20-22 ULB) \n\nThe context for Matthew 20:15 includes the emotion of envy. \"Is your eye evil?\" means \"Are you envious?\"\n>Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions? Or is your eye evil because I am good? (Matthew 20:15 ULB) \n\nIf a person's eye is evil is envious of other people's money. \n>The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness! No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. (Matthew 6:22-24 ULB)\n\nA person who is envious might put a curse or enchantment on someone by looking at him with an evil eye.\n>Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? (Galatians 3:1 ULB) \n\nA person with a good eye can put a blessing on someone by looking at him.\n\n> If I have found favor in your eyes... (1 Samuel 27:5 ULB)\n\n#### Life is modeled as BLOOD \n\nIn this model, the blood of a person or an animal represents its life.\n\n>But you must not eat meat with its life—that is its blood—in it. (Genesis 9:4 ULB)\n\nIf blood is spilled or shed, someone has been killed.\n\n>Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed, (Genesis 9:6 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>In this way, this person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge <u>the blood that was shed</u>, until the accused person would first stand before the assembly. (Joshua 20:9 ULB)</blockquote>\n\nIf blood cries out, nature itself is crying out for vengeance on a person who killed someone. (This also includes personification, because the blood is pictured as someone that can cry out. See: [Personification](figs_personification.md))\n\n>Yahweh said, \"What have you done? Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground. (Genesis 4:10 ULB) \n\n#### A country is modeled as a WOMAN, and its gods are modeled as HER HUSBAND\n\n>It came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, the people of Israel turned again and <u>prostituted themselves</u> by worshiping the Baals. They made Baal Berith their god. (Judges 8:33 ULB)\n\n#### The nation of Israel is modeled as GOD'S SON\n\n>When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called <u>my son</u> out of Egypt.  (Hosea 11:1 ULB)\n\n\n#### The sun is modeled as BEING IN A CONTAINER AT NIGHT\n\n>Yet their words go out over all the earth and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched <u>a tent for the sun</u> among them. The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of <u>his chamber</u> and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race. (Psalm 19:4-5 ULB)\n\nPsalm 110 pictures the sun as being in the womb before it comes out in the morning. \n>from <u>the womb</u> of the dawn your youth will be to you like the dew.  (Psalm 110:3 ULB)\n\n\n#### Things that can move fast are modeled as having WINGS \n\nThis is especially true of things that move in the air or the sky.\n\nThe sun is modeled as a disc with wings, which allow it to \"fly\" through the air from east to west during the daytime. In Psalm 139, \"the wings of the morning\" refers to the sun. In Malachi 4 God called himself the \"sun of righteousness\" and he spoke of the sun as having wings.\n\n>If I fly away on the wings of the morning and go to live in the uttermost parts across the sea. (Psalm 139:9 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. (Malachi 4:2 ULB)</blockquote>\n\nThe wind moves quickly and is modeled as having wings.\n\n>He was seen flying on the wings of the wind. (2 Sam. 22:11 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>He rode on a cherub and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind. (Psalm 18:10 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n>you walk on the wings of the wind (Psalm 104:3 ULB)\n\n#### Futility is modeled as something that the WIND can blow away \n\nIn this model, the wind blows away things that are worthless, and they are gone.\n\nPsalm 1 and Job 27 show that wicked people are worthless and will not live long.\n\n>The wicked are not so,  \n>but are instead <u>like the chaff that the wind drives away</u>. (Psalm 1:4 ULB)\n\n><u>The east wind carries him away</u>, and he leaves;  \n>it sweeps him out of his place. (Job 27:21 ULB)\n\nThe writer of Ecclesiastes says that everything is worthless.\n><u>Like a vapor of mist</u>,  \n><u>like a breeze in the wind</u>,  \n>everything vanishes, leaving many questions.  \n>What profit does mankind gain from all the work that they labor at under the sun?  (Ecclesiastes 1:2-3 ULB)\n\nIn Job 30:15, Job complains that his honor and prosperity are gone.\n\n>Terrors are turned upon me;  \n>my honor is <u>driven away as if by the wind</u>;  \n>my prosperity <u>passes away as a cloud</u>.  (Job 30:15  ULB)\n\n#### Human warfare is modeled as DIVINE WARFARE  \nWhen there was a war between nations, people believed that the gods of those nations were also at war.  \n\n>This happened while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, those whom Yahweh had killed among them, for he also inflicted punishment on their gods. (Numbers 33:4 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>And what nation is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom you, God, went and rescued for yourself?...You drove out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you rescued from Egypt. (2 Samuel 7:23 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n>The servants of the king of Aram said to him, \"Their god is a god of the hills. That is why they were stronger than we were. But now let us fight against them in the plain, and surely there we will be stronger than they.\" (1 Kings 20:23 ULB)\n\n\n#### Constraints in life are modeled as PHYSICAL BOUNDARIES\n\nThe verses below are not about real physical boundaries but about difficulties or the lack of difficulties in life.\n\n>He has built <u>a wall</u> around me, and I cannot escape. He has made my shackles heavy. (Lamentations 3:7 ULB)\n\n<blockquote>He has blocked my path with <u>walls of hewn stone</u>; every way I take is crooked. (Lamentations 3:9 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n><u>Measuring lines</u> have been laid for me in pleasant places (Psalm 16:6 ULB)\n\n#### Dangerous places are modeled as NARROW PLACES\n\nIn Psalm 4 David asks God to rescue him.\n\n>Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness;  \n>give me room <u>when I am hemmed in</u>.  \n>Have mercy on me and listen to my prayer. (Psalm 4:1 ULB)\n\n\n#### A distressing situation is modeled as a WILDERNESS \n\nWhen Job was distressed because of all the sad things that happened to him, he spoke as if he were in a wilderness. Jackals and ostriches are animals that live in the wilderness.\n>My heart is troubled and does not rest;  \n>days of affliction have come on me.  \n>I go about with darkened skin but not because of the sun;  \n>I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.  \n>I am <u>a brother to jackals</u>,  \n><u>a companion of ostriches</u>.  (Job 30:27-29 ULB)\n\n#### Wellbeing is modeled as PHYSICAL CLEANLINESS, and evil is modeled as PHYSICAL DIRTINESS \n\nLeprosy is a disease. If a person had it, he was said to be unclean.\n>Behold, a leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, \"Lord, if you are willing, <u>you can make me clean</u>.\" Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, \"I am willing. Be clean.\" Immediately he was <u>cleansed of his leprosy.</u> (Matthew 8:2-3 ULB)\n\nAn \"unclean spirit\" is an evil spirit.\n>When an <u>unclean spirit</u> has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it. (Matthew 12:43 ULB)\n",

The word in all capital letters represents an image. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.\n\n#### LIGHT represents someone's face  (This often combines with FACE represents someone's presence)\n\n<blockquote>Yahweh, lift up the light of your face on us. (Psalm 4:6 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>For they did not obtain the land for their possession by their own sword,  \n>neither did their own arm save them;  \n>but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face,  \n>because you were favorable to them.

(Psalm 89:15 ULB)\n\n\n\n#### LIGHT represents goodness, and DARKNESS represents evil\n\n\n>But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness!  (Matthew 6:23 ULB)\n\n\n\n#### LIQUID represents a moral quality (emotion, attitude, spirit, life)\n\n>Yahweh has burst through my enemies before me like a bursting flood of water. (2 Samuel 5:20 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>He will make a full end to his enemies with an overwhelming flood. (Nahum 1:8 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>My heart drips because of sadness. (Psalm 119:28 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>I am being poured out like water. (Psalm 22:14 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n\n>It will come about afterward that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.

(2 Chronicles 34:21 ULB)\n\n\n#### FIRE represents extreme feelings, particularly love or anger \n\n>Because iniquity will be increased, the love of many will be extinguished. (Matthew 24:12 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>Surging waters cannot quench love. (Song of Solomon 8:7 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>For a fire is kindled by my anger and is burning to the lowest sheol.  (Deuteronomy 32:22 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>Therefore the anger of Yahweh was set on fire against Israel. (Judges 3:8 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>When Yahweh heard this, he was angry; so his fire burned against Jacob, and his anger attacked Israel. (Psalm 78:21 ULB)\n\n\n#### FIRE OR A LAMP represents life \n\n>They say, 'Hand over the man who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed.' And so they would also destroy the heir. Thus they will put out the __burning coal__ that I have left, and they will leave for my husband neither name nor descendant on the surface of the earth. 2 Samuel 14:7 ULB) \n\n\n<blockquote>You must not go to battle anymore with us, so that you do not put out the lamp of Israel.

The word in all capital letters represents an idea. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.\n\n\n#### A BRANCH represents a person's descendant\n\nIn the examples below, Isaiah wrote about one of Jesse's descendants and Jeremiah wrote about one of David's descendants.\n>A shoot will sprout from the root of Jesse, and a branch out of his root will bear fruit.  \n>The Spirit of Yahweh will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding.

Later people started to make coins. The daric is one such coin.  In New Testament times, people used silver and copper coins.\n\nThe two tables below show some of the most well-known units of money found in the Old Testament (OT) and New Testament (NT). The table for Old Testament units shows what kind of metal was used and how much it weighed. The table for New Testament units shows what kind of metal was used and how much it was worth in terms of a day's wage.\n\n| Unit in OT | Metal  | Weight  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| daric     | gold coin  | 8.4 grams      |\n| shekel | various metals |  11 grams |\n| talent | various metals |  33 kilograms| \n \n\n| Unit in NT |  Metal |  Day's Wage  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| denarius/denarii | silver coin |  1 day |\n| drachma | silver coin |  1 day |\n| mite | copper coin|  1/64 day |\n| shekel | silver coin |  4 days |\n| talent | silver |  6,000 days |\n\n#### Translation Principle\n\nDo not use modern money values since these change from year to year.

People added these later, and then others numbered the chapters and verses to make it easier to find particular parts of the Bible. Since more than one person did this, there are different numbering systems. Some people use Bibles with one numbering system and some use Bibles with another numbering system.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\nPeople who speak your language may also use a Bible written in another language. If that Bible and your translation use different chapter and verse numbers, it will be hard for people to know which verse someone is talking about when they say a chapter and verse number.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n><sup>14</sup> But I expect to see you soon, and we will speak face to face. <sup>**15**</sup> Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name. (3 John 1:14-15 ULB)\n\nSince 3 John has only one chapter, some versions do not mark the chapter number. In the ULB and UDB it is marked as chapter 1. Also, some versions to do not divide verses 14 and 15 into two verses. Instead they mark it all as verse 14.\n\n>*A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.*\n\n><sup>1</sup> Yahweh, how many are my enemies! (Psalm 3:1 ULB)\n\nSome of the psalms have an explanation before them. In some versions the explanation is not given a verse number, as in the ULB and UDB. In other versions the explanation is verse 1, and the actual psalm starts with verse 2.\n\n>and Darius the Mede received the kingdom when he was about sixty-two years old. (Daniel 5:31 ULB) \n\nIn some versions this is the last verse of Daniel 5. In other versions this is the first verse of Daniel 6. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n1. If the people who speak your language have another Bible that they use, number the chapters and verses the way it does. Read the instructions on how to mark verses in the translationStudio APP.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\nIf the people who speak your language have another Bible that they use, number the chapters and verses the way it does. \n\nThe example below is from 3 John 1. Some Bibles mark this text as verses 14 and 15, and some mark it all as verse 14.  You may mark the verse numbers as your other Bible does. \n\n  * **<sup>14</sup> But I expect to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.** <sup>15</sup> **Peace be to you.

Greet the friends by name.\"(3 John 14)\n\nNext is an example from Psalm 3. Some Bibles do not mark the explanation at the beginning of the psalm as a verse, and others mark it as verse 1. You may mark the verse numbers as your other Bible does.\n\n***A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.***  \n<sup>1</sup> **Yahweh, how many are my enemies!**  \n**Many have turned away and attacked me.**  \n<sup>2</sup> **Many say about me,**  \n**\"There is no help for him from God.\" *Selah***\n\n<sup>1</sup> *A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.*   \n<sup>2</sup> Yahweh, how many are my enemies!  \nMany have turned away and attacked me.  \n<sup>3</sup> Many say about me,  \n\"There is no help for him from God.\" *Selah*  \n\n\n",

Numbers like these are used in the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).\n\nIn some countries people use a decimal point, and in other countries people use a decimal comma. So translators in countries that use a decimal comma would write \"3.7 meters\" as \"3,7 meters.\" In some cultures people prefer fractions. (See: [Fractions](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_fraction.md))\n\nIn the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) parts of a number are written as decimals or fractions. When they are used with a measurement such as meters, grams, and liters, the are usually written as decimals. \n\n#### Decimal Numbers in the UDB\n\n| Decimal | Fraction  | Simpler Fraction  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n|.1 |one tenth |  | \n|.2 |two tenths | one fifth | \n|.3 |three tenths |  | \n|.4 |four tenths | two fifths| \n|.5 |five tenths | one half | \n|.6 |six tenth | three fifths | \n|.7 |seven tenths |   | \n|.8 |eight tenths | four fifths | \n|.9 |nine tenths |  | \n|.25 |twenty-five one hundredths | one fourth | \n|.75 |seventy-five one hundredths | three fourths |\n\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * If translators want to use the measures in the UDB, the will need to be able to understand the decimal numbers that are used with them. \n  * Translators will need to write the numbers in a way that their readers will understand them.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nFor telling about parts of a number, the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB) uses fractions, and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) uses mostly decimals when the number is used with a measurement. Another difference between the ULB and the UDB is that when measuring [Biblical Distance](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_bdistance.md), [Biblical Weight](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_bweight.md), and [Biblical Volume](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_bvolume.md), they use different systems, so the numbers in the ULB and the UDB are not the same for these measures.\n>They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be <u>two and a half cubits</u>; its width will be <u>one cubit and a half</u>; and its height will be <u>one cubit and a half</u>.  (Exodus 25:10 ULB)\n\nThe ULB uses the fraction \"half.\" This can also be written as a decimal: .5. \n>Tell the people to make a sacred chest from acacia wood. It is to be <u>one meter</u> long, <u>0.7 meter wide</u>, and <u>0.7 meter</u> high.(Exodus 25:10 UDB)\n\nThe UDB uses the decimal 0.7. This equals seven tenths.\n\nTwo and a half cubits is about one meter.\n\nOne and a half cubits is about .7 meter or seven tenths of a meter.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n* Decide whether you want to use only fractions, only decimals, or a combination of the two.  \n* Decide whether you want to use the measures given in the ULB or the UDB or some other kind of measures.\n* If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the ULB, simply translate the numbers and measures in the  ULB.\n* If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the UDB, simply translate the numbers and measures in the UDB.\n\n\n1. If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the ULB, you will need to change the fractions in the ULB to decimals.\n1. If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the UDB, you will need to change the decimals in the UDB to fractions.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the ULB, you will need to change the fractions in the ULB to decimals.\n\n  * **<u>three tenths of an ephah</u> of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and <u>one log</u> of oil.** (Leviticus 14:10 ULB)\n      * \" <u>0.3 ephah</u> of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and <u>one log</u> of oil.\"\n\n2. If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the UDB, you will need to change the decimals in the UDB to fractions.\n\n  * **<u>about 6.5 liters</u> of a fine flour offering, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and about <u>one third liter</u> of olive oil.** (Leviticus 14:10 UDB)\n      * \"<u>about six and a half liters</u> of a fine flour offering, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and about <u>one third liter</u> of olive oil.\"\n\n\n",

For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,**...**\" he said to the paralytic, \"Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.\" (ULB)\n\nIn Mark 11:31-33 The ellipsis mark shows that either the religious leaders did not finish their sentence, or Mark did not finish writing what they said.\n\n>They discussed between themselves and argued and said, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' But if we say, 'From men,' **...**\" They feared the people, for they all held that John was a prophet. Then they answered Jesus and said, \"We do not know.\" Then Jesus said to them, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\" (ULB)\n\n\n#### Long Dashes\n\nLong dashes (—) introduce information that is immediately relevant to what came before it. For example:\n\n>Then two men will be in a field**—**one will be taken, and one will be left behind. Two women will be grinding with a mill**—**one will be taken, and one will be left. Therefore be on your guard, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come. (Matthew 24:40-41 ULB)\n\n#### Parentheses\n \nParentheses \"( )\" are used to show that some information is an explanation or afterthought. It does not contribute as well as the material around it to the point of the passage.\n\nIn verse John 6:6, John he interrupted the story he was writing to explain that Jesus already knew what he was going to do. This is put in parentheses.\n\n><sup>5</sup>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him, he said to Philip, \"Where are we going to buy bread so that these may eat?\" <sup>6</sup> **(**Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.**)**<sup>7</sup>Philip answered him, \"Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to have even a little.\" (John 6:5-7 ULB)\n\nThe words in the parentheses below are not what Jesus was saying, but what Matthew was saying to the reader. \n\n>Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place **(**let the reader understand**)**, let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house, 18and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak.  (Matthew 24:15-18 ULB)\n\n####  Indentation\n \nWhen text is indented, it means that the line of text starts further to the right than the lines of text above and below it that are not indented. This is done for poetry and some lists. For example:\n\n><sup>5</sup> These are the names of the leaders who must fight with you:  \n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tribe of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur;  \n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> from the tribe of Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai;  \n>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> from the tribe of Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; (Numbers 1:5-7 ULB)\n",

Some languages do not have this kind of number.\n\n### Description\n\nFractions are a kind of number that refer to equal parts of a thing or to equal groups within a larger group of people or things.  An item or a group of items is divided into two or more parts or groups, and a fraction refers to one or more of those parts or groups.  \n>For the drink offering, you must offer <u>a third</u> of a hin of wine. (Numbers 15:7 ULB)   \n\nA hin is a container used for measuring wine and other liquids. They were to divide a hin container into three parts and fill up only one part and offer that. \n><u>a third</u> of the ships were destroyed. (Revelation 8:9 ULB) \n\nThere were many ships. If all those ships were divided into three equal groups of ships, one group of ships was destroyed.  \n \nMost fractions in English simply have \"-th\" added to the end of the number. \n\n| Number of parts the whole is divided into | Fraction  |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| four | fourth | \n| ten | tenth | \n| one hundred | one hundredth |\n| one thousand | one thousandth |\n\n \nSome fractions in English do not follow that pattern. \n\n| Number of parts the whole is divided into | Fraction  |\n| -------- | -------- |\n| two | half | \n| three | third | \n| five | fifth |\n\n\n \n**Reason this is a translation issue:** Some languages do not have fractions. They may simply talk about parts or groups, but they do not use fractions to tell how big a part is or how many are included in a group. \n \n### Examples From the Bible\n\n>Now to <u>one half</u> of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given them an inheritance in Bashan, but to the other <u>half</u>, Joshua gave an inheritance beside their brothers in the land west of the Jordan.  (Joshua 22:7 ULB) \n\nThe tribe of Manasseh divided into two groups.  The phrase \"one half of the tribe of Manasseh\" refers one of those groups. The phrase \"the other half\" refers to the other group. \n>The four angels who had been prepared for that very hour, that day, that month, and that year, were released to kill <u>a third</u> of humanity. (Revelation 9:15 ULB) \n\nIf all the people were to be divided into three equal groups, then the number of people in one group would be killed. \n>You must also prepare <u>a fourth</u> of a hin of wine as the drink offering. (Numbers 15:5 ULB) \n\nThey were to divide a hin of wine into four equal parts and prepare one of them.  \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf a fraction in your language would give the right meaning, consider using it. If not, you could consider these strategies.\n\n  1. Tell the number of parts or groups that the item would be divided into, and then tell the number of parts or groups that is being referred to. \n  1. For measurements such as for weight and length, use a unit that your people might know or the unit in the UDB. \n  1. For measurements, use ones that are used in your language. In order to do that you would need to know how your measurements relates to the metric system and figure out each measurement. \n\n### Examples of These Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Tell the number of parts or groups that the item would be divided into, and then tell the number of parts or groups that is being referred to. \n\n  * **<u>A third</u> of the ocean became red like blood**  (Revelation 8:8 ULB) \n      * \"It was like they <u>divided</u> the ocean <u>into three parts</u>, and <u>one part</u> of the ocean became blood.\" \n\n  * **then you must offer with the bull a grain offering of <u>three tenths</u> of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.**  (Numbers 15:9 ULB)\n      * \"then you must <u>divide</u> an ephah of fine flour <u>into ten parts</u> and mix <u>three of those parts</u> with half a hin of oil. Then you must offer that grain offering along with the bull.\" \n\n2. For measurements, use the measurements that are given in the UDB. The translators of the UDB have already figured how to represent the amounts in the metric system. \n\n  * **<u>two thirds of a shekel</u>**  (1 Samuel 13:21 ULB)\n      * \"<u>eight grams</u> of silver\"  (1 Samuel 13:21 UDB)  \n\n  * **<u>three tenths of an ephah</u> of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.**  (Numbers 15:9, ULB) \n      * \"<u>6.5 liters</u> of finely ground flour mixed with about two liters of olive oil.\" (Numbers 15:9 UDB) \n\n3.

Unlike the western calendar, its first month begins  in the spring of the northern hemisphere. Sometimes a month is called by its name (Abib, Ziv, Sivan), and sometimes it is called by its order in the Hebrew calendar year (first month, second month, third month). \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue \n\n* Readers may be surprised to read of months that they have never heard of, and they may wonder how those months correspond to the months they use.\n* Readers may not realize that phrases such as \"the first month\" or \"the second month\" refer to the first or second month of the Hebrew calendar, not some other calendar.\n* Readers may not know when the first month of the Hebrew calendar begins.\n* The scripture may tell about something happening in a certain month, but readers will not be able to fully understand what is said about it if they do not know what season of the year that was.\n\n#### List of Hebrew Months  \nThis is a list of the Hebrew months with information about them that may be helpful in the translation.\n\n**Abib** - (This month is called **Nisan** after the Babylonian exile) - This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. It marks when God brought the people of Israel out of Egypt. It is at the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. It is during the last part of March and the first part April on western calendars. The Passover celebration started on Abib 10, the Festival of Unleavened Bread was right after that, and the Festival of Harvest was a few weeks after that.\n\n**Ziv** - This is the second month of the Hebrew calendar. This is during the harvest season. It is during the last part of April and the first part of May on western calendars.\n\n**Sivan** - This is the third month of the Hebrew calendar. It is at the end of the harvest season and the beginning of the dry season. It is during the last part of May and the first part of June on western calendars. The Feast of Weeks is celebrated on Sivan 6.\n\n**Tammuz** - This is the fourth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the dry season. It is during the last part of June and the first part of July on western calendars.\n\n**Ab** - This is the fifth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the dry season. It is during the last part of July and the first part of August on western calendars.\n\n**Elul** - This is the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is at the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season. It is during the last part of August and the first part of September on western calendars.\n\n**Ethanim** - This is the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. This is during the early rain season which would soften the land for sowing. It is during the last part of September and the first part of October on western calendars. The Feast of Ingathering and the Day of Atonement are celebrated in this month.\n\n**Bul** - This is the eighth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the rainy season when people plough their fields and sow seed. It is during the last part of October and the first part of November on western calendars.\n\n**Kislev** - This is the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar. This is at the end of the sowing season and the beginning of the cold season. It is during the last part of November and the first part of December on western calendars.\n\n**Tebeth** - This is the tenth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the cold season when there may be rain and snow. It is during the last part of December and the first part of January on western calendars.\n\n**Shebat** - This is the eleventh month of the Hebrew calendar. This is the coldest month of the year, and it has heavy rain fall. It is during the last part of January and the first part of February on western calendars.\n\n**Adar** - This is the twelfth and last month of the Hebrew calendar. This is during the cold season. It is during the last part of February and the first part of March on western calendars. The feast called Purim is celebrated in Adar.\n\n#### Examples from the Bible \n\n<blockquote> You are going out of Egypt on this day, in <u>the month of Abib</u>. (Exodus 13:4 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n> You must eat unleavened bread from twilight of the fourteenth day <u>in the first month of the year</u>, until twilight of the twenty-first day of the month. (Exodus 12:18 ULB)\n\n#### Translation Strategies \nYou may need to make some information about the months explicit. (See: [Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_explicit.md))\n\n1. Tell the the number of the Hebrew month.\n1. Use the months that people know. \n1. State clearly what season the month occurred in. \n1. Refer to the time in terms of the season rather than in terms of the month. (If possible, use a footnote to show the Hebrew month and day.)\n\n#### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied \n\nThe examples below use these two verses.\n\n  * **At that time, you will appear before me in <u>the month of Abib</u>, which is fixed for this purpose. It was in this month that you came out from Egypt.** (Exodus 23:15 ULB)\n  * **It will always be a statute for you that in <u>the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month,</u> you must humble yourselves and do no work** (Leviticus 16:29 ULB)\n\n1. Tell the number of the Hebrew month.\n  * \"At that time, you will appear before me in <u>the first month of the year</u>, which is fixed for this purpose. It was in this month that you came out from Egypt.\"\n1. Use the months that people know. \n  * \"At that time, you will appear before me in <u>the month of March</u>, which is fixed for this purpose. It was in this month that you came out from Egypt.\" \n  *  It will always be a statute for you that <u>on the day I choose in late September</u> you must humble yourselves and do no work\" \n1. State clearly what season the month occurred.\n  * \"It will always be a statute for you that <u>in the autumn, on the tenth day of the seventh month,</u> you must humble yourselves and do no work.\"\n1. Refer to the time in terms of the season rather than in terms of the month. \n  * \"It will always be a statute for you that in <u>the day I choose in early autumn</u> you must humble yourselves and do no work\"\n\n\n",

The people of Israel spoke Hebrew, so most of the Old Testament books were written in Hebrew. When they lived as strangers in Assyria and Babylon, they learned to speak Aramaic, and parts of the Old Testament were written in Aramaic.\n\nAbout three hundred years before Christ came, many people in Europe and the Middle East spoke Greek as a second language. So the Old Testament was translated into Greek. When Christ came, many people still spoke Greek as a second language, and the New Testament books were all written in Greek.\n\nBack then there were no printers, so the authors wrote these books by hand. These were the original manuscripts. Those who copied these manuscripts also did so by hand. These were also manuscripts. These books are extremely important, so the copiers got special training and were very careful to try to copy them accurately.\n\nOver hundreds of years, people made thousands of copies of the Bible books. The manuscripts that the authors originally wrote have all been lost or fallen apart, so we do not have them. But we do have many of the copies that were written long ago. Some of these copies have survived for many hundreds and even thousands of years.\n\n",

They can be written as words, such as \"five\" or as numerals, such as \"5\". Some numbers are very large, such as \"two hundred\" (200), \"twenty-two thousand\" (22,000) or \"one hundred million\" (100,000,000.) Some languages do not have words for all of these numbers. Translators need to decide how to translate numbers and whether to write them as words or numerals. \n \n### Description\n\nThere are many numbers in the Bible. Some are small, such as \"five\" (5) and \"fifteen\" (15). Others are very large, such as \"two hundred\" (200), twenty-two thousand (22,000) or \"one hundred million\" (100,000,000). Some numbers are exact and others are rounded. \n>Abram was <u>eighty-six</u> years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram. (Genesis 16:16 ULB)\n\nEighty-six (86) is an exact number.\n>That day about <u>three thousand</u> men out of the people died. (Exodus 32:28 ULB)\n\nHere the number three thousand is a round number. It may have been a little more than that or a little less than that. The word \"about\" shows that it is not an exact number. \n\n**Reason this is a translation issue**: Some languages do not have words for some of these numbers. \n\n#### Translation Principles\n\n  * Exact numbers should be translated as closely and specifically as they can be.\n  * Rounded numbers can be translated more generally. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>When Jared had lived <u>162</u> years, he became the father of Enoch. After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived <u>eight hundred</u> years. He became the father of more sons and daughters. Jared lived <u>962</u> years, and then he died. (Genesis 5:18-20 ULB)\n\nThe numbers 162, eight hundred, and 962 are exact numbers and should be translated with something as close to those numbers as possible.\n>Our sister, may you be the mother of <u>thousands of ten thousands</u> (Genesis 24:60 ULB)\n\nThis is a rounded number. It does not say exactly how many descendants she should have, but it was a huge number of them. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. Write numbers using numerals.\n  1. Write numbers using your language's words or the gateway language words for those numbers.\n  1. Write numbers using words, and put the numerals in parenthesis after them.\n  1. Combine words for large numbers.\n  1. Use a very general expression for very large rounded numbers and write the numeral in parentheses afterward.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\nWe will use the following verse in our examples:\n>Now, see, at great effort I have prepared for Yahweh's house <u>100,000</u> talents of gold, <u>one million</u> talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities. (1 Chronicles 22:14 ULB)\n\n2. Write numbers using numerals.\n\n  * \"I have prepared for Yahweh's house <u>100,000</u> talents of gold, one <u>1,000,000</u> talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities.\"\n\n3. Write numbers using your language's words or the gateway language words for those numbers.\n\n  * \"I have prepared for Yahweh's house <u>one hundred thousand</u> talents of gold, <u>one million</u> talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities. \"\n\n4. Write numbers using words, and put the numerals in parenthesis after them.\n\n  * \"I have prepared for Yahweh's house one <u>hundred thousand (100,000)</u> talents of gold, <u>one million (1,000,000)</u> talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities.\n\n5. Combine words for large numbers. \n\n   * \"I have prepared for Yahweh's house <u>one hundred thousand</u> talents of gold, <u>a thousand thousand</u> talents of silver, and bronze and iron in large quantities.  \n\n6. Use a very general expression for very large rounded numbers and write the numeral in parentheses afterward.\n\n  * \"I have prepared for Yahweh's house <u>a great amount of gold (100,000 talents)</u>, <u>ten times that amount of   silver (1,000,000 talents)</u>, and bronze and iron in large quantities. \n\n#### Consistency\n\nBe consistent in your translations. Decide how the numbers will be translated, using numbers or numerals. There are different ways of being consistent. \n\n  * Use words to represent numbers all of the time. (You might have very long words.)  \n  * Use numerals to represent numbers all of the time. \n  * Use words to represent the numbers that your language has words for and use numerals for the numbers that your language does not have words for. \n  * Use words for low numbers and numerals for high numbers. \n  * Use words for numbers that require few words and numerals for numbers that require more than a few words. \n  * Use words to represent numbers, and write the numerals in parentheses after them. \n\n#### Consistency in the ULB and UDB\n\nThe ULB (Unlocked Literal Bible) and the UDB (Unlocked Dynamic Bible) use words for numbers that have only one or two words (nine, sixteen, three hundred). They use numerals for numbers that have more than two words (the numerals \"130\" instead of \"one hundred thirty\"). \n>When Adam had lived <u>130</u> years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and he called his name Seth. After Adam became the father of Seth, he lived <u>eight hundred</u> years. He became the father of more sons and daughters. Adam lived <u>930</u> years, and then he died.  (Genesis 5:3-5 ULB) \n",

There are different ways to deal with this. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>The <u>first</u> lot went to Jehoiarib, the <u>second</u> to Jedaiah, the <u>third</u> to Harim, the <u>fourth</u> to Seorim, … the <u>twenty-third</u> to Delaiah, and the <u>twenty-fourth</u> to Maaziah.  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18 ULB)\n\nPeople tossed lots and one went to each of these people in the order given.\n\n>You must place in it four rows of precious stones. The <u>first</u> row must have a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet. The <u>second</u> row must have an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  The <u>third</u> row must have a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.  The <u>fourth</u> row must have a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper. They must be mounted in gold settings.  (Exodus 28:17-20 ULB)\n\nThis describes four rows of stones. The first row is probably be the top row, and the fourth row is probably the bottom row.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf your language has ordinal numbers and using them would give the right meaning, consider using them. If not, here are some strategies to consider:\n\n  1. Use \"one\" with the first item and \"another\" or \"the next\" with the rest. \n  1. Tell the total number of items and then list them or the things associated with them.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Tell the total number of items, and use \"one\" with the first item and \"another\" or \"the next\" with the rest. \n\n  * **The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,  the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, … the twenty-third to Delaiah,  and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.**  (1 Chronicles 24:7-18 ULB)\n      * \"There were <u>twenty-four</u> lots. <u>One lot</u> went to Jehoiarib, <u>another</u> to Jedaiah, <u>another</u>  to Harim,…  <u>another</u> to Delaiah, <u>and the last</u> went to Maaziah.\"\n      * \"There were <u>twenty-four</u> lots. <u>One lot</u> went to Jehoiarib, <u>the next</u> to Jedaiah, <u>the next</u>  to Harim,…  <u>the next</u> to Delaiah, <u>and the last</u> went to Maaziah.\"\n\n  * **A river went out of Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became <u>four</u> rivers. The name of <u>the first</u> is Pishon. It is the one which flows throughout the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. The gold of that land is good. There is also bdellium and the onyx stone there. The name of <u>the second</u> river is Gihon. This one flows throughout the whole land of Cush.  The name of <u>the third</u> river is Tigris, which flows east of Asshur. <u>The fourth</u> river is the Euphrates.**(Genesis 2:10-14 ULB)\n      * \"A river went out of Eden to water the garden.

The original language of the New Testament is Greek. The original language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the original language of some parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The original language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.\n\nThe source Language is the language from which the translation is being made. If a translator is translating the Bible from the original languages, then the original language and the source language for his translation are the same. However, only people who have spent many years studying the original languages understand them and can use them as a source language. For that reason, most translators use Bibles that have been translated into a language of wider communication as their source language text. \n\nIf you are translating from a language of wider communication, it is a good idea to have someone who has studied the original languages compare the meaning in the target language translation with the meaning in the original language to make sure that the meaning is the same. Another way to make sure that the meaning of the target language translation is accurate is to check the translation with translation helps that have been written by people who know the original languages. These would include Bible commentaries and dictionaries, as well as the unfoldingWord translationNotes, translationWords definitions, and translationQuestions with their answers.\n\n### The Text in the Source Language may not be Accurate\n\nIf the translator does not understand the original language, he will have to use a language of wider communication as a source language. The meaning in the source may be correct, depending on how carefully it was translated from the original. But it is still a translation, so it is a step away from the original and is not quite the same. In some cases, the source may have actually been translated from another source, rather than from the original, putting it two steps away from the original.\n\nConsider the example below. A translator uses a Swahili New Testament as the source for a new target language translation. However, the particular Swahili Bible version he is using was actually translated from English — not directly from the Greek (the original language of the NT). So it is possible that some of the meaning has changed in the chain of translation from the original to the target languages. \n![](http://cdn.door43.org/ta/jpg/ol2sl2sl2tl_small_600-174.png)\n\nThe only way to make sure the translation is as accurate as possible is to compare the new translation with the original languages. Where this is not possible, use the ULB as the source text, along with other Bible translations that were translated from the original languages. \n\n",

For example, in some cultures people nod their head up and down to mean \"Yes\" or turn their head from side to side to mean \"No\". Symbolic actions do not mean the same things in all cultures.\n\nTranslators need to understand what people in the Bible meant when they used symbolic actions. If an action does not mean the same thing in their own culture, they need to figure out how to translate what the action meant.\n\n### Description\n\nA symbolic action is something that someone does in order to express a certain idea. An action does not have to actually be performed; it may simply be referred to.  \n\n#### Examples of symbolic actions\n\n  * In some cultures people shake hands when they meet to show that they are willing to be friendly.\n  * In some cultures people bow when they  meet to show respect to each other. \n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\nAn action may have a meaning in one culture, and a different meaning or no meaning at all in another culture.  For example, in some cultures raising the eyebrows means \"I am surprised\" or \"What did you say?\" In others cultures it means \"Yes.\"  \n\nIn the Bible people did things that had certain meanings in their culture. When we read the Bible we might not understand what someone meant if we interpret the action based on what it means in our own culture. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet.  (Luke 8:41 ULB)\n\nMeaning of symbolic action: He did this to show great respect to Jesus. \n>Look, I stand at the door and <u>knock</u>. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to his home, and have a meal with him, and he with me. (Revelation 3:20 ULB)\n\nMeaning of symbolic action: When people want someone to welcome them into their home, they stand at the door and knock on it. \n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf people would correctly understand what a symbolic action meant to the people in the Bible, consider using it. If not, here are some strategies for it.\n\n1. Tell what the person did and why he did it.  \n1. Do not tell what the person did, but tell what he meant. \n1. Use an action from your own culture that has the same meaning. Do this only in poetry, parables, and sermons. Do not do this when there actually was a person who did a specific action.  \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Tell what the person did and why he did it. \n\n  * **Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet.** (Luke 8:41 ULB) \n      * \"Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet in order to show that he greatly respected him.\" \n\n  * **Look, I stand at the door and knock.** (Revelation 3:20 ULB) \n      * \"Look, I stand at the door and knock on it, asking you to let me in.\" \n\n2. Do not tell what the person did, but tell what he meant. \n\n  * **Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet.** (Luke 8:41) \n      * \"Jairus showed Jesus great respect.\" \n\n  * **Look, I stand at the door and knock.** (Revelation 3:20) \n      * \"Look, I stand at the door and ask you to let me in.\" \n\n3. Use an action from your own culture that has the same meaning. \n\n  * **Jairus fell down at Jesus' feet.** (Luke 8:41 ULB) - Since Jairus actually did this, we would not substitute an action from our own culture.\n\n  * **Look, I stand at the door and knock.** (Revelation 3:20 ULB) -  Jesus was not standing at a real door. Rather he was speaking about wanting to have a relationship with people. So in cultures where it is polite to clear one's throat when wanting to be let into a house, you could use that.\n      * \"Look, I stand at the door and clear my throat.\"\n\n",

In the ULB, these added sentences are usually written in footnotes.\n\n### Description\n\nThousands of years ago, people wrote the books of the Bible. Other people copied them by hand and translated them. They did this work very carefully, and over the years many people made thousands of copies. However people who looked at them later saw that there were small differences between them. Some copiers accidentally left out some words, and some mistook a word for another that looked like it. Occasionally they added words or even whole sentences, either by accident, or because they wanted to explain something.\n\nBible scholars have read many old copies and compared them with each other. For each place in the Bible where there was a difference, they have figured out which wordings are most likely correct. The translators of the ULB based the ULB on wordings that scholars say are most likely correct. Because people who use the ULB may have access to Bibles that are based on other copies, the ULB translators included footnotes that tell about some of the differences between them. \n\nTranslators are encouraged to translate the text in the ULB and to write about added sentences in footnotes, as is done in the ULB. However, if the local church really wants those sentences to be included in the main text, translators may put them in the text and include a footnote about them.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nMatthew 18:10-11 ULB has a footnote about verse 11. \n><sup>10</sup>See that you do not despise any of these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always look on the face of my Father who is in heaven. <sup>11</sup><sup>[1]</sup>\n\n<sup>[1]</sup> Many authorities, some ancient, insert v. 11. *For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.*\n\nJohn 7:53-8:11 is not in the best earliest manuscripts. It has been included in the ULB, but it is marked off with square brackets ([ ]) at the beginning and end, and there is a footnote after verse 11. \n><sup>53</sup>[Then every man went to his own house.…  <sup>11</sup>She said, \"No one, Lord.\" Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on sin no more.\"]<sup>[2]</sup>\n\n<sup>[2]</sup>The best earliest manuscripts do not have John 7:35-8:11\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nWhen there is a textual variant, you may choose to follow the ULB or another version that you have access to.\n\n  1. Translate the verses that the ULB does and include the footnote that the ULB provides.\n  1. Translate the verses as another version does, and change the footnote so that it fits this situation.  \n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\nThe translation strategies are applied to Mark 7:15-16 ULB, which has a footnote about verse 16.\n\n  * <sup>14</sup>**He called the crowd again and said to them, \"Listen to me, all of you, and understand. <sup>15</sup>There is nothing from outside of a person that can defile him when it enters into him.

Order of Ideas \n\nThe ULB tries to present ideas **in the same order** as they appear in the source text.\n\nThe UDB tries to present ideas in an order that is more natural in English, or that follows the order of logic or the order of sequence in time.\n\nWhen you translate, you should put ideas into an order that is natural in the target language. (See: [Order of Events](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_events.md))\n\n><sup>1</sup>  Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God...<sup>7</sup>  This letter is to all who are in Rome, the beloved of God. (Romans 1:1,7 **ULB**)\n\n\n\n><sup>1</sup>  I, Paul, who serve Christ Jesus, am writing this letter to all of you believers in the city of Rome. (Romans 1:1 **UDB**)\n\nThe ULB shows Paul's style of beginning his letters. He does not say who his audience is until verse 7. However, the UDB follows a style that is much more natural in English and most other languages today.\n\n### 2. Implied Information \n\nThe scriptural text often presents ideas that **imply** or **assume** other ideas that are important for the reader to understand.\n\nThe UDB often makes those other ideas explicit. The UDB does this in order to remind you that you should perhaps do the same in your translation if you think that your audience will need to know this information in order to understand the text.\n\nWhen you translate, you should decide which of these implied ideas would be understood by your audience without being included. If your audience understands these ideas without including them in the text, then you do not need to make those ideas explicit. Remember also that you might even offend your audience if you needlessly present implied ideas that they would understand anyway. (See: [Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_explicit.md))\n\n>And Jesus said to Simon, \"Do not be afraid, because from now on you will catch men.\" (Luke 5:10 **ULB**)  \n\n\n> But Jesus said to Simon, \"Do not be afraid! _Until now you gathered in fish_, but from now on you will gather in people to become my disciples.\" (Luke 5:10 **UDB**)\n\nHere the UDB reminds the reader that Simon was a fisherman by trade. It also makes clear the similarity that Jesus was drawing between Simon's previous work and his future work. In addition, the UDB makes it clear why Jesus wanted Simon to \"catch men\" (ULB), that is, \"to become my disciples\" (UDB).\n\n>When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\" (Luke 5:12 **ULB**)\n\n\n\n>When he saw Jesus, he *bowed down to the ground* in front of him and pleaded with him, \"Lord, please heal me, because you are able to heal me if you are willing!\" (Luke 5:12 **UDB**)\n\nHere the UDB makes it clear that the man who had leprosy did not fall to the ground by accident. Instead, he deliberately bowed down to the ground. Also, the UDB makes it clear that he is asking Jesus to heal him. In the ULB, he only implies this request.\n\n### 3. Symbolic Actions \nA symbolic action is something that someone does in order to express a certain idea. The ULB often simply presents the symbolic action with no explanation of what it means.  \nThe UDB often presents the meaning expressed by the symbolic action as well. \n\nWhen you translate, you should decide whether your audience will correctly understand a symbolic action. If your audience will not understand, then you should do as the UDB does. (See: [Symbolic Action](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/translate_symaction.md))\n>The high priest tore his garments (Mark 14:63 **ULB**)\n\n\n>In response to Jesus' words, the high priest _was so shocked_ that he tore his outer garment.  (Mark 14:63 **UDB**)\n\nHere the UDB makes it clear that it was not by accident that the high priest tore his garment. It also makes clear that it was probably only his outer garment that he tore, and that he did so because he wanted to show that he was sad or angry or both. In this case, because the high priest actually tore his garment, the UDB must of course say that he did.\n\nHowever, you do not have to represent a symbolic action in your translation, if that action never actually took place.\n\n>Present that to your governor; will he accept you or will he *lift up your face*?\" (Malachi 1:8 **ULB**) \n\n>You would not dare to offer such gifts to your own governor! You know that he would not take them. You know that _he would be displeased with you!_ (Malachi 1:8 **UDB**) \n\nHere the symbolic action \"lift up someone's face,\" represented in this way in the ULB, is presented only as its meaning in the UDB: \"he would be displeased with you and would not welcome you.\" It can be presented in this way because Malachi is not actually referring to a particular event that actually took place. He is only referring to the idea represented by that event.\n\n###  4. Passive Verb Forms \n\nThe ULB uses a wider variety of verb forms than the UDB does. Languages differ greatly from each other in how they express actions, events, and conditions. For example, both Biblical Hebrew and Greek often use passive verb forms, while many other languages do not have that possibility.\n\nThe ULB uses passive verb forms when the original languages do so.\nThe UDB usually does not use these passive verb forms. As a result, the UDB **restructures** many phrases.\n\nWhen you translate, you must decide whether the target language can present events or states using a passive expression, as in the following examples. Many languages do not use passive expressions at all, while other languages make some use of them in limited situations. Still other languages make widespread use of passive expressions. If you cannot use a passive verb form in a particular context, then you may find in the UDB one possible way to restructure the phrase. (See: [Active or Passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_activepassive.md))\n\n>For _he was amazed_, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken. (Luke 5:9 **ULB**)  \n   \n      \n>He said this because _he marveled_ at the huge number of fish that they had caught. All the men who were with him also marveled. (Luke 5:9 **UDB**)\n\nHere the UDB uses a verb in the active voice (\"he marveled\") instead of the ULB's verb in the passive voice (\"was amazed\").\n\n> Large crowds of people came together to hear him teach and _to be healed_ of their sicknesses. (Luke 5:15 **ULB**)  \n\n\n>The result was that large crowds came to Jesus to hear him teach and _to have him heal them_ from their sicknesses. (Luke 5:15 **UDB**)\n\nHere the UDB avoids the ULB's passive verb form \"to be healed.\" It does this by restructuring the phrase. It says who the healer is: \"to have him [Jesus] heal them.\"\n\n###  5. Metaphors and Other Figures of Speech \n\nThe ULB tries to represent the figures of speech found in the biblical texts as closely as possible.\n\nThe UDB often presents the meaning of these ideas in other ways.\n\nWhen you translate, you will have to decide whether the target language readers will understand a figure of speech with little effort, with some effort, or not at all. If they have to make a great effort to understand, or if they do not understand at all, you will have to present the essential meaning of the figure of speech using other words.\n\n>He has _made you rich in every way_, in all speech and with all knowledge. (1 Corinthians 1:5 **ULB**)\n\n>Christ has _given you so many things_. He helped you to speak his truth and to know God. (1 Corinthians 1:5 **UDB**)\n\nPaul uses a metaphor of material wealth, expressed in the word \"rich.\" Even though he immediately explains what he means (\"in all speech and with all knowledge\"), some readers might not understand. The UDB presents the idea in a different way, without using the metaphor of material wealth. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))\n\n>I send you out _as sheep in the midst of wolves_, (Matthew 10:16 **ULB**)\n\n>When I send you out, you will be _as defenseless as sheep, among people who are as dangerous as wolves_. (Matthew 10:16 **UDB**)\n\nJesus uses a simile that compares his apostles going to others as sheep going out among wolves. Some readers might not understand how the apostles would be like sheep while the other people would be like wolves. The UDB clarifies that the apostles would be defenseless, and that their enemies would be dangerous. (See: [Simile](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_simile.md))\n\n>You are separated from Christ, all _you who are \"justified\" by the law_. You have fallen away from grace. (Galatians 5:4 **ULB**)\n\n>_If you expect God to declare you good in his sight because you try to keep the law_, you have separated yourself from Christ; God will no longer act kindly toward you. (Galatians 5:4 **UDB**)\n\nPaul uses irony when he refers to them as being justified by the law. He had already taught them that no one can be justified by the law. The ULB uses quote marks around \"justified\" to show that Paul did not really believe that they were justified by the law. The UDB translates the same idea by making it clear that it was what the other people believed. (See: [Irony](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_irony.md))\n\n###  6. Abstract Expressions \n\nThe ULB often uses abstract nouns, adjectives, and other parts of speech, because it tries to closely resemble the biblical texts.\nThe UDB tries not to use such abstract expressions, because many languages do not use abstract expressions.\n\nWhen you translate, you will have to decide how the target language prefers to present these ideas. (See: [Abstract Nouns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_abstractnouns.md))\n\n>He has made you rich in every way, in _all speech_ and with _all knowledge_. (1 Corinthians 1:5 **ULB**)\n\n\n\n>Christ has given you so many things. He _helped you to speak his truth_ and _to know God_. (1 Corinthians 1:5 **UDB**)\n\nHere the ULB expressions \"all speech\" and \"all knowledge\" are abstract noun expressions. One problem with them is that readers might not know who is supposed to do the speaking and what they are to speak, or who is doing the knowing and what it is that they know. The UDB answers these questions.\n\n###  Conclusion \n\nIn summary, the ULB will help you translate, because it can help you understand to a great degree what form the original biblical texts have. The UDB can help you translate, because it can help make the ULB text's meaning clear, and also because it can give you various possible ways to make the ideas in the biblical text clear in your own translation. \n",

This is called a verse bridge. The numbers are written like this because the information in the verses was rearranged.\n\n### Description\n\nIn rare cases, you will see in the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB) or the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) that two or more verse numbers are combined, such as 17-18. This is called a verse bridge. It shows where the information in the verses was rearranged so that the story or message could be more easily understood.\n\n><sup>29</sup> These were the clans of the Horites: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah, <sup>30</sup> Dishon, Ezer, Dishan: these are clans of the Horites, according to their clan lists in the land of Seir.  (Genesis 26:29-30 **ULB**)\n\n><sup>29-30</sup> The people groups who were descendants of Hor lived in Seir land. The names of the people groups are Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishpan.  (Genesis 26:29-30 **UDB**)\n\nIn the ULB text, verses 29 and 30 are separate, and the information about the people living in Seir is at the end of verse 30. In the UDB text, the verses are joined, and the information about them living in Seir is at the beginning. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nSometimes the ULB has separate verses while the UDB has a verse bridge. \n\n><sup>4</sup> However, there should be no poor among you (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land that he gives you as an inheritance to possess), <sup>5</sup> if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all these commandments that I am commanding you today.  (Deuteronomy 15:4-5 **ULB**)\n\n><sup>4-5</sup> Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that he is giving to you. If you obey Yahweh our God and obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today, there will not be any poor people among you. (Deuteronomy 15:4-5 **UDB**) \n\nThere are also a few verse bridges in the ULB. \n\n><sup>17-18</sup> Ezrah's sons were Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon. Mered's Egyptian wife bore Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah, who became the father of Eshtemoa. These were the sons of Bithiah, daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered married. Mered's Jewish wife bore Jered, who became the father of Gedor; Heber, who became the father of Soco; and Jekuthiel, who became the father of Zanoah.  (1 Chronicles 4:17-18 ULB)\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nOrder the information in a way that will be clear to your readers. \n\n  1. If you put information from one verse before information from an earlier verse, put a hyphen between the two verse numbers.\n  1. If the ULB has a verse bridge, but another Bible you refer to does not have one, you can choose the order that works best for your language.\n\nSee how to mark verses in the translationStudio APP.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If information from one verse is put before information from an earlier verse, put the verse numbers before the first verse with a hyphen between them.\n\n  * **<sup>2</sup> you must select three cities for yourself in the middle of your land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess. <sup>3</sup> You must build a road and divide the borders of your land into three parts, the land that Yahweh your God is causing you to inherit, so that everyone who kills another person may flee there.** (Deuteronomy 19:2-3)\n      * <sup>2-3</sup> you must divide into three parts the land that he is giving to you. Then select a city in each part. You must make good roads in order that people can get to those cities easily. Someone who kills another person can escape to one of those cities to be safe. (Deuteronomy 19:2-3 UDB)\n\n2. If the ULB has a verse bridge, but another Bible you refer to does not have one, you can choose the order that works best for your language.\n\n",

These messages use images and symbols to show what God will do in the future.\n\nThe main books that have these prophecies are Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Revelation. Shorter examples of symbolic prophecy are also found in other books, such as in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21.\n\nThe Bible tells both how God gave each message and what the message was. When God gave the messages, he often did so in miraculous ways such as in dreams and visions. (See *dream* and *vision* pages in [translationWords](https://unfoldingword.org/en/?resource=translation-words) for help translating \"dream\" and \"vision\".) When prophets saw these dreams and visions, they often saw images and symbols about God and heaven. Some of these images are a throne, golden lamp stands, a powerful man with white hair and white clothes, and eyes like fire and legs like bronze. Some of these images were seen by more than one prophet.\n\nThe prophecies about the world also contain images and symbols. For example, in some of the prophecies strong animals represent kingdoms, horns represent kings or kingdoms, a dragon or serpent represents the devil, the sea represents the nations, and weeks represent longer periods of time. Some of these images were also seen by more than one prophet.\n\nThe prophecies tell about the evil in this world, how God will judge the world and punish sin, and how God will establish his righteous kingdom in the new world he is creating. They also tell about things that will happen concerning heaven and hell. \n\nSome of these writings are presented as poetry and some are presented as narrative. They usually use the past tense because the prophets tell about what they saw in their visions or dreams. But they are about things that would happen in the future. Some of these things happened after the prophets told about them, and some of them will happen at the end of this world.\n\n\nReason this is a translation issue: Some of the images are hard to understand because we have never seen things like them before. \n\n#### Translation Principles \n  * Translate the images in the text. Do not try to interpret them and translate their meaning.\n  * When the same image appears in more than one place in the Bible, and it is described in the same way, try to translate it the same way in all those places.\n  * Sometimes it is difficult to understand what order the events described in the various prophecies happen. Simply write them as they appear in each prophecy.\n\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nThe following passages describe powerful beings that Ezekiel, Daniel, and John saw. Images that come up in these visions include hair that is white as wool, a voice like many waters, a golden belt, and legs or feet like polished bronze. Though the prophets saw various details, it would be good to translate the details that are the same in the same way.\n\n<blockquote> In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a Son of Man, wearing a long robe that reached down to his feet, and a golden belt around his chest.  <u>His head and hair were as white as wool</u> — as white as snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze, like bronze that had been refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters. He had in his right hand seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp two-edged sword. His face was shining like the sun at its strongest shining. (Revelation 1:13-16 ULB) </blockquote>\n\n\n>As I looked,  \n>thrones were set in place,  \n>and the Ancient of Days took his seat.  \n>His clothing was as white as snow,  \n>and _the hair of his head was like pure wool_. (Daniel 7:9 ULB) \n\n\n<blockquote>I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen, with a belt around his waist made of pure gold from Uphaz. His body was like topaz, his face was like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and his feet were like polished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the sound of a great crowd. (Daniel 10:5-6 ULB)</blockquote>\n\n\n>Behold! The glory of the God of Israel came from the east; his voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory! (Ezekiel 43:2 ULB)\n\n",

Sometimes a writer may give some background information to help his listeners understand the story. The background information might be about things that happened before the events he has already told about, or it might explain something in the story, or it might be about something that would happen much later in the story. The story teller and translator need to tell the story in a way that people will know whether an event is background information and will be able to understand what order the events happened in.\n\n### Description\n\nEvery story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events mostly in the time order that the events happened. It is full of action verbs that moves the reader along the storyline. Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break is called **background information.**  The underlined sentences in the story below are all background information.\n\nPeter and John went on a hunting trip because <u>their village was going to have a a feast the next day</u>. <u>Peter was the best hunter in the village.</u> <u>He once killed three wild pigs in one day!</u> They walked for hours through low bushes until they found  a wild pig. They shot the pig and killed it. Then they tied up its legs with some rope <u>they had brought with them</u>, and carried it home on a pole. When they brought it to the village, Peter's cousin saw the pig and realized that <u>it was his own pig</u>. <u>Peter had mistakenly killed his cousin's pig</u>.\n\nOften background information uses \"be\" verbs like \"was\" and \"were\", rather than action verbs. Examples of these are \"Peter <u>was</u> the best hunter in the village\" and \"it <u>was</u> his own pig.\"\n\nSometimes a storyteller makes a break in the story to tell about something that had happened earlier or something that would happen much later. Examples of these are \"their village was going to have a a feast the next day\" and \"He once killed three wild pigs in one day,\" \"that they had brought with them,\" and \"Peter had mistakenly killed his cousins's pig.\n\n#### A writer may use background information\n\n  * to help their listeners be interested in the story.\n  * to help their listeners understand something in the story.\n  * to help the listeners understand why something is important in the story.\n  * to tell the setting of a story. Setting includes:\n     * where the story takes place.\n     * when the story takes place.\n     * who is present when the story begins.\n     * what is happening when the story begins.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue\n\n  * Translators need to know whether or not the events in the Bible happened in the same order that they are told. \n  * Translators will need to translate the story in a way that their own readers will understand the order of events. \n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. Abram <u>was</u> eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.  (Genesis 16:16 ULB)\n\nThe first sentence tells about two events. Hagar gave birth and Abraham named his son. The second sentence is background information about how old Abram was when those things happened.\n\n>Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, <u>was</u> about thirty years of age. He <u>was</u> the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.   (Luke 3:23 ULB) \n\nThe verses before this tell about when Jesus was baptized. This sentence introduces background information about Jesus' age and ancestors. The story starts up again in chapter 4 where it tells about Jesus going to the wilderness.\n\n>Now it happened on a Sabbath that Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them between their hands, and eating the grain. But some of the Pharisees said... (Luke 6:1-2a ULB)\n\nThese verses give the setting of the story. The events took place in a grain field on the Sabbath day. Jesus, his disciples, and some Pharisees were there, and Jesus' disciples were picking heads of grain and eating them. The main action in the story starts with the sentence \"But some of the Pharisees said.\"\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nTo keep translations clear and natural you will need to study the grammar and punctuation of your language. Observe how your language presents background information in writings. Follow those same grammar rules when you translate.\n\n  1. Use your language's way of showing that certain information is background information.\n  1. Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first.  (This is not always possible when the background information is very long.)\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies applied\n\n1. Use your language's way of showing that certain information is background information. The examples below explain how this was done in the ULB English translations.\n\n  * **Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, <u>was</u> about thirty years of age. He <u>was</u> the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.** (Luke 3:23 ULB) - English uses the word \"now\" to show that there is some kind of change in the story. The verb \"was\" shows that it is background information.\n\n\n  * **With many other exhortations also, he preached good news to the people. John also rebuked Herod the tetrarch <u>for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias</u>, and <u>for all the other evil things that Herod had done</u>. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.**  (Luke 3:18-20 ULB) The underlined phrases happened before John rebuked Herod. In English, the helping verb \"had\" in \"had done\" shows that Herod did those things before John rebuked him.\n\n2. Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first. \n\n  * **Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. <u>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram</u>.** (Genesis 16:16 ULB)\n      * \"<u>When Abram was eighty-six years old</u>, Hagar gave birth to his son, and Abram named his son Ishmael.\" \n\n  * **John also rebuked Herod the tetrarch <u>for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias</u>, and <u>for all the other evil things that Herod had done</u>. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.**  (Luke 3:18-20) -  The translation below reorders John's rebuke and Herod's actions. \n      * \"Now Herod the tetrarch married his brother's wife, Herodias, and he did many other evil things, so John rebuked him. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.\"\n\n",

I did not have an umbrella. I got very wet.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\n  * Translators need to understand the meaning of a connecting word in the Bible and the relationship between the thoughts it is connecting.\n  * Each language has its own ways of showing how thoughts are related.\n  * Translators need to know how to help their readers understand the relationship between the thoughts.\n\n#### Translation Principles\n\n  * Translators need to translate in a way that readers can understand the same relationship between thoughts that the original readers would have understood.\n  * Whether or not a connecting word is used is not as important as readers being able to understand the relationship between the ideas.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n><u>And</u> when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate it. <u>And</u>  she gave some also to her husband who was with her, <u>and</u> he ate it.  (Genesis 3:6 ULB)\n\nThe word \"and\" can connect words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. The underlined examples above show where it connects clauses and sentences. In this verse, the event that follows \"and\" happened after the event before \"and\".\n>I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me, <u>but</u>  instead I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus. <u>Then</u>  after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.  (Galatians 1:16-18 ULB)\n\nThe word \"but\" introduces something that contrasts with what was said before. The contrast here is between what Paul did not do with what he did do. Here the word \"then\" introduces something Paul did after he returned to Damascus.    \n>Therefore whoever breaks the least one of these commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. <u>But</u>  whoever keeps them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:19 ULB)\n\nHere the word \"But\" contrasts what one group of people will be called in God's kingdom with what another group of people will be called.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the way the relationship between thoughts is shown in the ULB would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, then consider using it. If not, here are some other options.\n\n  1. Use a connecting word (even if the ULB does not use one).\n  1. Do not use a connecting word if it would be odd to use one and people would understand the right relationship between the thoughts without it.\n  1. Use a different connecting word.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Use a connecting word (even if the ULB does not use one).\n\n  * **Jesus said to them, \"Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men.\" Immediately they left the nets and went after him.**  (Mark 1:17-18 ULB) - They followed Jesus because he told them to. Some translators may want to mark this with \"so.\"\n      * \"Jesus said to them, \"Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men.\" <u>So</u>  immediately they left the nets and went after him.\"\n\n2. Do not use a connecting word if it would be odd to use one and people would understand the right relationship between the thoughts without it.\n\n  * **And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate it. <u>And</u>  she gave some also to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.**  (Genesis 3:6 ULB) - The word \"and\" here simply shows that something else happened. Some languages would not need to start the sentence with \"and.\"\n      * \"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate it.

Often this is background information. This background information is different from the actions that make up the main part of the story. A book of the Bible is often made up of many smaller stories that are part of the larger story of the book itself. For example, the story of Jesus' birth is a smaller story in the larger story of the book of Luke. Each of these stories, whether large or small, can have background information at the end of it. \n\n#### Different purposes for end of story information:\n\n  * to summarize the story\n  * to give a comment about what happened in the story\n  * to connect a smaller story to the larger story it is a part of\n  * to tell the reader what happens to a specific character after the main part of the story ends\n  * to tell on-going action that continues after the main part of the story ends\n  * to tell what happens after the story as a result of the events that happened in the story itself\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue: \n\nDifferent languages have different ways of presenting these kinds of information.

To summarize the story\n>Then the rest of the men should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. **In this way it happened that all of us came safely to land.** (Acts 27:44 ULB)\n\n2. To give a comment about what happened in the story\n> Many who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they counted the value of them, it was fifty thousand pieces of silver. **So the word of the Lord spread very widely in powerful ways.** (Acts 19:19-20 ULB)\n\n3. To tell the reader what happens to a specific character after the main part of the story ends\n> Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her house. (Luke 1:56 ULB)\n\n4. To tell on-going action that continues after the main part of the story ends\n> All who heard it were amazed at what was spoken to them by the shepherds. **But Mary kept thinking about all the things she had heard, treasuring them in her heart.** (Luke 2:18-19 ULB)\n\n5. To tell what happens after the story as a result of the events that happened in the story itself\n> After Jesus left there, the scribes and the Pharisees opposed him and argued with him about many things, trying to trap him in his own words.

In every translation, the way that words, sentences, and paragraphs are arranged will affect how people will understand the message.\n\n### Kinds of Writing Styles:\n\nThe following are four basic writing styles based on the kind of information they give.\n\n  * **Narrative**  or **[Parables](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_parables.md)**- tells a story or event\n  * **Explanatory**  - explains facts or teaches principles\n  * **Procedural**  - tells how to do something\n  * **Argumentative**  - tries to persuade someone to do something\n\nThe following writing styles often present challenges in translation. \n\n  * **[Poetry](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_poetry.md)**- expresses ideas and feelings in a beautiful way\n  * **[Proverbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_proverbs.md)**- briefly teaches a truth or wisdom\n  *  **[Symbolic Language](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_symlanguage.md)** - uses symbols to represent things and events  \n  *  **[Symbolic Prophecy](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_apocalypticwriting.md)** - uses symbolic language to show what will happen in the future  \n  *  **[Hypothetical Situations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_hypo.md)** - tells about what would happen if something were real or expresses an emotion about something that is not real.  \n\nThe purpose of a particular text will influence what kinds of discourse features are used. For example, in a narrative, discourse features would include:\n\n  * telling about events that happen before and after other events;\n  * introducing people in the story;\n  * introducing new events in the story;\n  * conversation and the use of quotes;\n  * referring to people and things with nouns or pronouns.\n\nLanguages have organized ways of communicating information in each of these discourse types.\n\n### Specific discourse issues:\n\n  1. **[Introduction of a New Event](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_newevent.md)**- Phrases like \"One day\" or \"It came about that\" or \"This is how it happened\" or \"Sometime after that\" signal to the reader that a new event is about to be told.\n  1. **[Introduction of New and Old Participants](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_participants.md)**- Languages have ways of introducing new people and of referring to those people again.\n  1. **[Background Information](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_background.md)**- An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.\n  1. **[Pronouns - When to Use Them](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_pronouns.md)**  - Languages have patterns for how frequently to use pronouns. If that pattern is not followed, wrong meaning can result.\n  2. **[End of Story](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_endofstory.md)** - Stories can end with various kinds of information. Languages have different ways of showing how that information is related to the story. \n  1. **[Quotations and Quote Margins](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_quotations.md)**- Languages have different ways of reporting what someone said.\n  1. **[Connecting Words](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_connectingwords.md)**- Languages have patterns for how to use connecting words (such as \"and,\" \"but,\" or \"then\").",

They may have certain ways of telling these things. For your translation to sound natural you may need to follow those ways.\n\n### Description\n\nWhen people tell a story, they tell about an event or a series of events. Often they put certain information at the beginning of the story, such as who the story is about, when it happened, and where it happened. New events in a story might involve new people, new times, and new places. In some languages people also tell if they saw the event or heard about it from someone else.\n\nWhen your people tell about events, what information do they give at the beginning? Is there a certain order that they put it in? You may need to change how and in what order new information is introduced at the beginning of a new event in order for your translation to sound natural in your language.\n\nHere are some examples of how some events are introduced in the books of Matthew and Luke.\n><u>In the days of Herod</u>, king of Judea, <u>there was a certain priest named Zechariah</u>, from the division of Abijah. <u>His wife was</u> from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. (Luke 1:5 ULB)\n\nThe verses above introduce a story about  Zechariah. The first underlined phrase tells when it happened, and the next two underlined phrase introduce the main people.\n> <u>One day</u> while Zechariah was performing his duties as a priest before God in the order of his division,  the priests followed their custom and chose him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. (Luke 1:8-9 ULB)\n\nLike 1:5-7 tell about Zechariah and Elizabeth being old and not having any children. The phrase <u>One day</u> helps to introduces the first event in this story. \n><u>The birth of Jesus Christ happened in the following way.</u> His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.  (Matthew 1:18 ULB)\n\nThe underlined sentence above makes it explicit that a story about Jesus is being introduced. The story will tell about how the birth of Jesus happened. \n><u>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king</u>, learned men from the east arrived in Jerusalem saying,…  (Matthew 2:1 ULB)\n\nThe underlined phrase above shows that the events concerning the learned men happened <u>after</u> Jesus was born.\n><u>In those days</u> John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying, … (Matthew 3:1-22 ULB)\n\nThe underlined phrase above shows that John the Baptist came preaching around the time of the previous events. It is probably very general and refers to when Jesus lived in Nazareth.\n><u>Then</u> Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. (Matthew 3:13 ULB)\n\nThe word \"then\" shows that Jesus came to the Jordan River some time after the events in the previous verses.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n> Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus at night time (John 3:1-2 ULB)\n\nThe author first introduced the new person and then told about what he did and when he did. In some languages it might be more natural to tell about the time first. \n><sup>6</sup>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth. <sup>7</sup>Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives went into the ark together because of the waters of the flood.  (Genesis 7:6,7 ULB)\n\nVerse 6 is a summary of the events that happen in the rest of the chapter. \nChapter 6 already told about how God told Noah that there would be a flood, and how Noah prepared for it. This sentence introduces the part of the story that tells about Noah and his family and the animals going into the ship, the rain starting, and the rain flooding the earth. Some languages might need to make it clear that this simply introduces the event. The people went into the ship before the flood came.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the information given at the beginning of a new event is clear and natural to your readers, consider translating it as it is in the ULB or UDB. If not, consider one of these strategies.\n\n  1. Put the information that introduces the event in the order that your people put it.\n  1. If readers would expect certain information but it is not in the Bible, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone.\n  1. If the introduction is a summary of the whole event, use your language's way of showing that it is a summary. \n  1. If it would be strange in the target language to give a summary of the event at the beginning, show that the event would actually happen later in the story.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. Put the information that introduces the event in the order that your people put it.\n\n  *  **Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council. This man came to Jesus at night time and said to him …**  (John 3:1,2)\n      *  \"There was a man whose name was Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish Council. One night he came to Jesus and said…\" \n      *  \"One night a man named Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish Council, came to Jesus and said …\" \n\n  * **As he passed by, <u>he saw Levi the son of Alpheus, who was sitting</u> at the tax collecting place, and he said to him …**  (Mark 2:14 ULB)\n      * \"As he passed by, <u>Levi the son of Alpheus was sitting</u> at the tax collecting place. Jesus saw him and and said to him …\"\n      * \"As he passed by, <u>there was a man sitting</u> at the tax collecting place. His name was Levi, and he was the son of Alpheus. Jesus saw him and said to him …\"\n      * \"As he passed by, <u>there was a tax collector</u> sitting at the tax collecting place. His name was Levi, and he was the son of Alpheus. Jesus saw him and said to him …\"\n\n2. If readers would expect certain information but it is not in the Bible, consider using an indefinite word or phrase such as: another time, someone.\n\n  * **Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth.** (Genesis 7:6 ULB) - If people expect to be told something about when the new event happened, the phrase \"after that\" can help them see that it happened after the events already mentioned.\n      * \"<u>After that</u>, when Noah was six hundred years old, the flood came upon the earth.\"\n\n  * **Again he began to teach beside the lake.** (Mark 4:1 ULB) - In chapter 3 Jesus was teaching at someone's house. Readers may need to be told that this new event happened at another time, or that Jesus actually went to the lake.\n      * \"<u>Another time</u> Jesus began to teach people again beside the lake.\"\n      * \"Jesus went to the lake and began to teach people again there.\"\n\n3. If the introduction is a summary of the whole event, use your language's way of showing that it is a summary. This is one way that it can be done in English.\n\n  * **Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth.** (Genesis 7:6 ULB)\n      * \"<u>Now this is what happened when</u> Noah was six hundred years old and the flood came upon the earth.\"\n\n4. If it would be strange in the target language to give a summary of the event at the beginning, show that the event would actually happen later in the story.\n\n  * **Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth. Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives went into the ark together because of the waters of the flood.** (Genesis 7:6 ULB)\n      * \"<u>Now this is what happened when</u> Noah was six hundred years old. Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives went into the ark together because <u>God had said that the waters of the flood would come</u>.\"\n",

After that, whenever they are mentioned, they are old participants. In order to make your translation clear and natural, you will need to refer to the participants in such a way that people will know if they are new participants or ones that they have already read about.\n\n### Description\n\nThe first time that people or things are mentioned in a story, they are <u>new participants</u>. After that, whenever they are mentioned, they are <u>old participants</u>.\n>Now <u>there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus</u>... <u>This man</u> came to Jesus at night time... Jesus replied to <u>him</u> (John 3:1) \n\nThe first underlined phrase introduces Nicodemus as a new participant. He is then referred to as \"This man\" and \"him\" when he is an old participant.\n\n#### Reason this is a translation issue\n\nIn order to make your translation clear and natural, it is necessary to properly refer to the participants in such a way that people will know if they are new participants or participants that they have already read about.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n#### New Participants\n\nSometimes a new participant is introduced with a phrase that says that he existed, such as \"There was a man\" in the example below. The phrase \"There was\" tells us that this man existed. The word \"a\" in \"a man\" tells us that that author is speaking about him for the first time. The rest of the sentence tells where this man was from, who is family was, and what his name was.\n><u>There was a man</u> from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. (Judges 13:2 ULB) \n\nSometimes a new participant is simply mentioned in relation to another person who was already introduced.  In the example below, Manoah's wife is simply referred to as \"his wife\". This phrase shows her relationship to him.\n>There was a man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. <u>His wife</u> was not able to become pregnant and so she had not given birth. (Judges 13:2 ULB)\n\nSometimes a new participant is introduced simply by name because the author assumes that the readers know who the person is. In the book of Judges, the first time that the angel of Yahweh is mentioned, he is referred to simply by his title.\n> The angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bochim, (Judges 2:1 ULB)\n\n\n#### Old Participants\n\nA person who has already been brought into the story, may then be referred to with a pronoun, with a noun phrase, or by name or title. In the example below, Manoah is referred to with the pronoun \"his,\" and his wife is referred to with the pronoun \"she\".\n\n><u>His</u> wife was not able to become pregnant and so <u>she</u> had not given birth. (Judges 13:2 ULB)\n\nIn the example below, Manoah's wife is referred to with the noun phrase \"the woman\".\n> The angel of Yahweh appeared to <u>the woman</u> and said to her, (Judges 13:3 ULB)\n\nIn the example below, Manoah is referred to with his name.\n> Then <u>Manoah</u> prayed to Yahweh\n\nSome languages have something on the verb that tells something about the subject. In some of those languages people do not always use noun phrases or pronouns for old participants when they are the subject of the sentence. The marker on the verb gives enough of a clue for the listener to understand who the subject is. (See: [Verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_verbs.md))\n\nIn some languages people do not always have to use a noun or noun phrase to refer to an old participant when that participant is the subject of a sentence. People can understand it from the context.\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\n  1. If it is a new participant, use one of your language's ways of introducing new participants.\n  1. If it is not clear who a pronoun refers to, use a noun phrase or name.\n  1. If an old participant is referred to by name or a noun phrase, and people wonder if this is another new participant, try using a pronoun instead. If a pronoun is not needed because people would understand it clearly from the context, then leave out the pronoun.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1. If it is a new participant, use one of your language's ways of introducing new participants.\n\n  * **Joseph, a Levite, a man from Cyprus, was given the name Barnabas by the apostles (that is, being interpreted, Son of encouragement).** (Acts 4:36-37 ULB)- Starting the sentence with Joseph's name when he has not been introduced yet might be too quick in some languages.\n      * \"There was a man named Joseph, from Cyprus. He was a Levite and he was given the name Barnabas by the apostles (that is, being interpreted, Son of encouragement).\"\n      * \"There was a Levite from Cyprus whose name was Joseph. The apostles gave him the name Barnabas, which means Son of encouragement.\"  \n\n2. If it is not clear who a pronoun refers to, use a noun phrase or name.\n\n  * **It happened when <u>he</u> finished praying in a certain place, that one of his disciples said, \"Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.\"** (Luke 11:1 ULB) - Since this is the first verse in a chapter, readers might wonder who \"he\" refers to.\n      * \"It happened when <u>Jesus</u> finished praying in a certain place, that one of his disciples said, \"Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.\"\n\n3. If an old participant is referred to by name or a noun phrase, and people wonder if this is another new participant, try using a pronoun instead. If a pronoun is not needed because people would understand it clearly from the context, then leave out the pronoun.\n\n  * **<u>Joseph's</u> master took <u>Joseph</u> and put <u>him</u> in prison, in the place where all the king's prisoners were put, and <u>Joseph</u> stayed there.** (Genesis 39:20 ULB) - Since Joseph is the main person in the story, some languages might find it odd to use his name so much. They might prefer a pronoun.\n      * \"Joseph's master took <u>him</u> and put <u>him</u> in prison, in the place where all the king's prisoners were put, and <u>he</u> stayed there in the prison.\"\n",

It is used to express a stronger emotional feeling than simple non-poetic forms would express. Poetry is easier to remember and tends to last longer than ordinary speech.\n\n#### Some things commonly found in poetry\n\n  * Many figures of speech such as [Apostrophe](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_apostrophe.md).\n  * Parallel lines (See: [Parallelism](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_parallelism.md) and [Parallelism with the Same Meaning](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_synonparallelism.md))\n  * Repetition of some or all of a line\n      * **Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his angel armies. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars.** (Psalm 148:2-3 ULB)\n  * Lines of similar length.\n      * **Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude.** (1 Corinthians 13:4 ULB)\n  * The same sound used at the end or at the beginning of two or more lines\n      * \"Twinkle, twinkle little <u>star</u>. How I wonder what you <u>are</u>.\" (from an English rhyme)\n  *  The same sound repeated many times\n      *  \"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater\" (from an English rhyme) \n  * Old words and expressions\n\n#### Some places to look for poetry in your language\n\n  1. Songs, particularly old songs or songs used in children's games\n  1. Religious ceremony or chants of priests or witch doctors\n  1. Prayers, blessings, and curses\n  1. Old legends\n\n#### Elegant or fancy speech\n\nElegant or fancy speech is similar to poetry in that it uses beautiful language, but it does not use all of the language's features of poetry, and it does not use them as much as poetry does. Popular speakers in the language often use elegant speech, and this is the probably the easiest source of text to study to find out what makes speech elegant in your language.\n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue:\n\n  * Different languages use poetry for different things. If a poetic form would not communicate the same meaning in your language you may need to write it without the poetry.  \n  * In some languages, using poetry for a particular part of the Bible would make it much more powerful.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\nThe Bible uses poetry for songs, teaching and prophecy. Almost all of the books of the Old Testament have poetry in them and many of the books are completely poetry. \n>for you saw my affliction;  \n>you knew the distress of my soul. (Psalm 31:7 ULB) \n\nThis example of [Parallelism with the Same Meaning](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_synonparallelism.md) has two lines that mean the same thing.\n>Yahweh, judge the nations;  \n>vindicate me, Yahweh, because I am righteous and innocent, Most High. \n\nThis example of parallelism shows the contrast between what David wants God to do to him and what he wants God to do to the unrighteous nations.  (See: [Parallelism](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_parallelism.md))\n>Keep your servant also from arrogant sins;  \n>let them not rule over me. (Psalm 19:13 ULB)\n\nThis example of personification speaks of sins as if they could rule over a person. (See: [Personification](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_personification.md))\n>Oh, give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.  \n>Oh, give thanks to the God of gods, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever.  \n>Oh, give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his covenant faithfulness endures forever. (Psalm 136:1-3 ULB) \n\nThis example repeats the phrases \"give thanks\" and \"his covenant faithfulness endures forever.\"\n\n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf the style of poetry that is used in the source text would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other ways of translating it.\n\n  1. Translate the poetry using one of your styles of poetry.\n  1. Translate the poetry using your style of elegant speech.\n  1. Translate the poetry using  your style of ordinary speech.\nIf you use poetry it may be more beautiful. \n\nIf you use ordinary speech it may be more clear.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n>**Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked,  \n>or stand in the pathway with sinners,  \n>or sit in the assembly of mockers.  \n>But his delight is in the law of Yahweh,  \n>and on his law he meditates day and night.** (Psalm 1:1,2 ULB)\n\nThe following are examples of how people might translate Psalm 1:1,2.\n\n1) Translate the poetry using one of your styles of poetry. (The style in this example has words that sound similar at the end of each line.)\n\n>\"Happy is the person not encouraged <u>to sin</u>  \n>Disrespect for God he will not <u>begin</u>  \n>To those who laugh at God, he is <u>no kin.</u>  \n>God is his constant <u>delight</u>  \n>He does what God says <u>is right</u>  \n>He thinks of it all day <u>and night</u>\n\n2) Translate the poetry using your style of elegant speech.\n\n* \"This is the kind of person who is truly blessed: the one who does not follow the advice of wicked people, or stop along the road to speak with sinners, or join the gathering of those who mock God. Rather he takes great joy in Yahweh's law, and he meditates on it day and night.\"\n\n3) Translate the poetry using your style of ordinary speech.\n\n  * \"The people who do not listen to the advice of bad people are really happy. They do not spend time with people who continually do evil things or with those who do not respect God. They love to obey Yahweh's law, and they think about it all the time.\"\n",

When you follow your language's rules for using pronouns, people will easily understand who and what your translation is about.\\\\  \n\n### Description\n\nWhen we talk or write, we use pronouns to refer to people or things without always having to repeat the noun or name. Usually the first time we refer to someone in a story, we use a descriptive phrase or a name. The next time we might refer to that person with a simple noun or by name. After that we might refer to him simply with a pronoun, as long as we think that our listeners will be able to understand easily who the pronoun refers to.\n\n> Now there was __a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council__. __This man__ came to Jesus … Jesus replied to __him__ (John 3:1-3 ULB)\n\n\nIn John 3, Nicodemus is first referred to with noun phrases and his name. Then he is referred to with the noun phrase \"this man.\" Then he is referred to with the pronoun \"him.\"\n\nEach language has its rules and exceptions to this usual way of referring to people and things. \n\n* In some languages the first time something is referred to in a paragraph or chapter, it is referred to with a noun rather than a pronoun.\n* The **main character** is who a story is about. In some languages, after a main character is introduced in a story, he is usually referred to with a pronoun. Some languages have special pronouns that refer only to the main character.\n* In some languages, marking on the verb helps people know who the subject is. (See: [Verbs](figs_verbs.md).) In some of these languages, listeners rely on this marking to help them understand who the subject is, and speakers use a pronoun, noun phrase, or name only when they want to emphasize or clarify who the subject is. \n\n#### Reasons this is a translation issue  \n\n  * If translators use a pronoun at the wrong time, readers might not know who the pronoun refers to. \n  * If translators frequently refer to a main character by name, listeners might not realize that the person is a main character.\n  * If translators use pronouns, nouns, or names at the wrong time, people might think that there is some special emphasis on the thing it refers to.\n\n### Examples from the Bible \n\nThe example below occurs at the beginning of a chapter. It some languages it might not be clear who the pronouns refer to.\n> Again Jesus walked into the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. __They__ watched __him__ to see if __he__ would heal __him__ on the Sabbath. (Mark 3:1-2 ULB)\n\n\nIn the example below, two men are named in the first sentence.

When you follow your language's ways of saying proverbs, you will make your translation sparkle.\n\n### Description\n\nProverbs are a sentence or a few sentences that give wisdom or teach a truth. Proverbs in the Bible often use metaphor and parallelism.\n>Hatred stirs up conflicts,  \n>but love covers over all offenses. (Proverbs 10:12 ULB)\n\n\n>Look at the ant, you lazy person, consider her ways, and be wise.  \n>It has no commander, officer, or ruler,  \n>yet it prepares its food in the summer,  \n>and during the harvest it stores up what it will eat. (Proverbs 6:6-8 ULB)\n\n \n#### Reason this is a translation issue:\n\nEach language has its own ways of saying proverbs. There are many proverbs in the Bible. They need to be translated in a way for people to recognize them as proverbs and understand what they teach.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>A good name is to be chosen over great riches,  \n>and favor is better than silver and gold. (Proverbs 22:1 ULB)\n\nThis means that it is better to be a good person and to have a good reputation than it is to have a lot of money. \n>Like vinegar on the teeth and smoke in the eyes,  \n>so is the sluggard to those who send him. (Proverbs 10:26 ULB)\n\nThis means that if  a person is lazy and does do what he was sent to do, he will be very annoying to those who send.\n>The way of Yahweh protects those who have integrity,  \n>but it is destruction for the wicked. (Proverbs 10:29 ULB)\n\nThis means that Yahweh protects people who do what is right, but he destroys those who are wicked.\n \n### Translation Strategies\n\nIf translating a proverb literally would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider doing that. If not, here are some options: \n\n  1. Find out how people say proverbs in your language, and use one of those ways. \n  1. If certain objects in the proverb are not known to many people in your language group, consider replacing them with objects that people know and that function in the same way in your language. \n  1. Substitute a proverb in your language that has the same teaching as the proverb in the Bible.\n  1. Give the same teaching but not in a form of a proverb.\n\n### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied\n\n1) Find out how people say proverbs in your language, and use one of those ways. \n\n  * **A good name is to be chosen over great riches,**  \n**and favor is better than silver and gold.** (Proverbs 22:1 ULB) \n\nHere are some ideas for ways people might say a proverb in their language.\n\n  * \"It is better to have a good name than to have great riches, and to be favored by people than to have silver and gold.\" \n  * \"Wise people choose a good name over great riches and favor over silver and gold.\"\n  * \"Try to have a good reputation rather than great riches.\"\n  * \"Will riches really help you? I would rather have a good reputation.\"\n\n2) If certain objects in the proverb are not known to many people in your language group, consider replacing them with objects that people know and that function in the same way in your language. \n\n * **Like <u>snow in summer</u> or rain in harvest,**  \n**so a fool does not deserve honor.** (Proverbs 26:1 ULB)\n\n  * \"It is not natural for <u>a cold wind to blow in the hot season</u> or for it to rain in the harvest season; And it is not natural to honor a foolish person.\"\n\n3) Substitute a proverb in your language that has the same teaching as the proverb in the Bible.\n\n  * **Do not boast about tomorrow** (Proverbs 27:1 ULB)\n      * \"Do not count your chickens before they hatch.\"\n\n4) Give the same teaching but not in a form of a proverb.\n\n  * **A generation that curses their father and does not bless their mother,**  \n**that is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,**  \n**but they are not washed of their filth.** (Proverbs 30:11-12 ULB)\n\n\n  * \"People who do not respect their parents think that they are righteous, and they do not turn away from their sin.\"\n\n",

In the Bible it occurs most in prophecy and poetry, especially in visions and dreams about things that will happen in the future. Though people may not immediately know the meaning of a symbol, it is important to keep the symbol in the translation.\n\n### Description\n\nSymbolic language in speech and writing is the use of symbols to represent other things and events. In the Bible it occurs most in prophecy and poetry, especially in visions and dreams about things that will happen in the future.\n>Eat this scroll, then go speak to the house of Israel.\" (Ezekiel 3:1 ULB) \n\nThis was in a dream. Eating the scroll is a symbol of reading and understanding well what was written on the scroll.\n\nOne purpose of symbolism is to help people understand the importance or severity of an event by calling it another. Another purpose of symbolism is to tell people about something that they would be able to understand while hiding the true meaning from others.\n\n**Reason this is a translation issue:**  People who read the Bible today may find it hard to recognize that the language is symbolic, and they may not know what the symbol stands for.\n\n**Translation Principle:**  When symbolic language is used, it is important to keep the symbol in the translation. It is also important not to explain it more than the original speaker or writer did, since he may not have wanted everyone living then to be able to understand it easily.\n\n### Examples from the Bible\n\n>After this I saw in my dream at night <u>a fourth animal</u>, terrifying, frightening, and very strong. It had <u>large iron teeth</u>; it devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had <u>ten horns</u>. (Daniel 7:7 ULB)\n\nThe meaning of the underlined symbols is explained in Daniel 7:23-24 as shown below. The animals represent kingdoms, iron teeth represent a powerful army, and the horns represent powerful leaders.\n>This is what that person said, 'As for the fourth animal, it will be <u>a fourth kingdom</u>  on earth that will be different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, and it will trample it down and break it into pieces. As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom <u>ten kings</u>  will arise, and another will arise after them. He will be different from the previous ones, and he will conquer the three kings. (Daniel 7:23-24 ULB)\n\n\n<blockquote>I turned around to see whose voice was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw <u>seven golden lampstands</u>. In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a Son of Man, … He had in his right hand <u>seven stars</u>, and coming out of his mouth was <u>a sharp two-edged sword</u>…. As for the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: <u>the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches</u>, and <u>the seven lampstands are the seven churches</u>. (Revelation 1:12, 16, 20 ULB) </blockquote>\n\nThis passage explains the meaning of the seven lampstands and the seven starts.
