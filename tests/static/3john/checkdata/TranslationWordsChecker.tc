For example, James emphasizes that he is talking about all believers when he refers to \"a brother or sister who is in need of food or clothing.\"\n\n===== Translation Suggestions: =====\n\n  * It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological brother, unless this would give wrong meaning.\n  * In the Old Testament especially, when \"brothers\" is used very generally to refer to members of the same family, clan, or people group, possible translations could include, \"relatives\" or \"clan members\" or \"fellow Israelites.\"\n  * In the context of referring to a fellow believer in Christ, this term could be translated as, \"brother in Christ\" or \"spiritual brother.\"\n  * If both males and females are being referred to and \"brother\" would give a wrong meaning, then a more general kinship term could be used that would include both males and females.\n  * Other ways to translate this term so that it refers to both male and female believers could be, \"fellow believers\" or \"Christian brothers and sisters.\"\n  * Make sure to check the context to determine whether only men are being referred to, or whether both men and women are included.\n\n(See also: [[:en:obe:kt:apostle|apostle, the twelve, the eleven]], [[:en:obe:kt:godthefather|God the Father, Heavenly Father]], [[:en:obe:other:sister]], [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])\n\n===== Bible References: =====\n\n{{door43pages @:en:bible:notes -r -q=\"\\{\\{tag>[^}]* brother(( )|(\\}))\" -exclude:home -simpleLineBreak -title -fontsize=\"100%\"}}~~DISCUSSION~~{{tag>publish}}",

Physically, it refers to when the physical body of a person stops living. Spiritually, it refers to sinners being separated from a holy God because of their sin.\n\n=== 1. Physical death ===\n\n  * To \"die\" means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.\n  * A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.\n  * When Adam and Eve sinned, physical death came into the world.\n  * The expression \"put to death\" refers to killing or murdering someone, especially when a king or other ruler gives an order for someone to be killed.\n\n=== 2. Spiritual death ===\n\n  * Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.\n  * Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. His relationship with God was broken. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.\n  * Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n===== Translation Suggestions: =====\n\n  * To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or expression that refers to death in the target language.\n  * In some languages, \"to die\" may be expressed as \"to not live.\" The term \"dead\" may be translated as \"not alive\" or \"not having any life\" or \"not living.\"\n  * Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as \"to pass away\" in English. However in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language.\n  * In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death.\n  * In some languages it may be more clear to say \"spiritual death\" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say \"physical death\" in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.\n  * The expression, \"the dead\" is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as, \"dead people\" or \"people who have died.\"  (See: nominal adjective)\n  * The expression, \"put to death\" could also be translated as, \"kill\" or \"murder\" or \"execute.\"\n\n(See also: [[:en:obe:kt:believe|]], [[:en:obe:kt:faith]], [[:en:obe:kt:life]], [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])\n\n===== Bible References: =====\n\n{{door43pages @:en:bible:notes -r -q=\"\\{\\{tag>[^}]* death(( )|(\\}))\" -exclude:home -simpleLineBreak -title -fontsize=\"100%\"}}\n\n===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====\n\n  * **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:01-11|[01-11]]]** God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

Something that is \"fruitful\" has a lot of fruit. These terms are also used figuratively in the Bible.\n\n  * The Bible often uses \"fruit\" to refer to a person's actions and thoughts.

For example, the \"fruit of wisdom\" refers to the good things that come from being wise.\n  * The expression \"fruit of the land\" refers generally to everything that the land produces for people to eat. This includes not only fruits such as grapes or dates, but also vegetables, nuts, and grains.\n  * The figurative expression \"fruit of the Spirit\" refers to godly qualities that the Holy Spirit produces in the lives of people who obey him.\n  * The expression, \"fruit of the womb\" refers to \"what the womb produces,\" that is, children.\n\n===== Translation Suggestions: =====\n\n  * It is best to translate this term using the general word for \"fruit\" that is commonly used in the project language to refer to the edible fruit of a fruit tree.

It is often used as a metaphor for righteousness, holiness, and truth.

Darkness is the absence of all light. \n  * Jesus said that he is \"the light of the world\" and that his followers should shine like lights in the world, by living in a way that clearly shows how great God is.\n  * \"Walking in the light\" represents living in a way that pleases God, doing what is good and right. Walking in darkness represents living in rebellion against God, doing evil things.\n \n===== Translation Suggestions: =====\n\n  * When translating, it is important to keep the literal terms \"light\" and \"darkness\" even when they are used figuratively.\n  * It may be necessary to explain the comparison in the text.

      "file": "====== love ======\n\n===== Definition: =====\n\nTo love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for \"love\" which some languages may express using different words:\n\n1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.\n\n  * Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.\n  * When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that show that someone is thinking of what will cause the other person to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.\n  * In the ULB, the word \"love\" refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.\n\n2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love or love for a friend or family member.\n\n  * This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.\n  * It can also be used in such contexts as, \"They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.\" This means that they \"like very much\" or \"greatly desire\" to do that.\n\n3. The word \"love\" can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.\n\n4. In the figurative expression, \"Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,\" the term \"loved\" refers to God's choosing of Jacob to be in a covenant relationship with him. This could also be translated as \"chosen.\" Although Esau was also blessed by God, he wasn't given the privilege of being in the covenant. The term \"hated\" is used figuratively here to mean \"rejected\" or \"not chosen.\"\n\n\n===== Translation Suggestions: =====\n\n  * Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word \"love\" in the ULB refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.\n  * Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, \"devoted, faithful caring\" or \"care for unselfishly\" or \"love from God.\" Make sure that the word used to translate God's love can include giving up one's own interests to benefit others and loving others no matter what they do.\n  * Sometimes the English word \"love\" describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means, \"like very much\" or \"care for\" or \"have strong affection for.\"\n  * In contexts where the word \"love\" is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by \"strongly prefer\" or \"like very much\" or \"greatly desire.\"\n  * Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.\n  * Many languages must express \"love\" as an action. So for example, they might translate \"love is patient, love is kind\" as, \"when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him.\"\n\n(See also: [[:en:obe:kt:covenant]], [[:en:obe:kt:death]], [[:en:obe:other:sacrifice]], [[:en:obe:kt:save]], [[:en:obe:kt:sin]])\n\n===== Bible References: =====\n\n{{door43pages @:en:bible:notes -r -q=\"\\{\\{tag>[^}]* love(( )|(\\}))\" -exclude:home -simpleLineBreak -title -fontsize=\"100%\"}}\n\n===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====\n\n  * **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:27-02|[27-02]]]** The law expert replied that God's law says, \"**Love**  the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.

The term \"pastor\" is the same word as \"shepherd.\" The elders and overseers were also called shepherds.\n\n\n===== Translation Suggestions =====\n\n  * When used literally, the action \"shepherd\" could be translated as \"take care of sheep\" or \"watch over sheep.\"\n  * The person \"shepherd\" could be translated as, \"person who takes care of sheep\" or \"sheep tender\" or \"sheep caregiver.\"\n  * When used as a metaphor, different ways to translate this term could include, \"spiritual shepherd\" or \"spiritual leader\" or \"one who is like a shepherd\" or \"one who cares for his people like a shepherd cares for his sheep\" or \"one who leads his people like a shepherd guides his sheep\" or \"one who takes care of God's sheep.\"\n  * In some contexts, \"shepherd\" could be translated as \"leader\" or \"guide\" or \"caregiver.\"\n  * The expression, \"to shepherd (a flock)\" could be translated as, \"to take care of\" or \"to spiritually nourish\" or \"to guide and teach\" or \"to lead and take care of (like a shepherd cares for sheep)\"\n  * In figurative uses, it is best to use or include the literal word for \"shepherd\" in the translation of this term.\n\n(See also: [[:en:obe:kt:believer]], [[:en:obe:other:canaan]], [[:en:obe:kt:church]], [[:en:obe:other:moses]], [[:en:obe:kt:pastor]], [[:en:obe:other:sheep]], [[:en:obe:kt:spirit]])\n\n===== Bible References: =====\n\n{{door43pages @:en:bible:notes -r -q=\"\\{\\{tag>[^}]* shepherd(( )|(\\}))\" -exclude:home -simpleLineBreak -title -fontsize=\"100%\"}}\n\n===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====\n\n  * **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:09-11|[09-11]]]** Moses became a **shepherd**  in the wilderness far away from Egypt.to\n  * **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:17-02|[17-02]]]** David was a **shepherd**  from the town of Bethlehem.

Other languages may also use different words depending on what is being planted.\n  * The expression, \"a person reaps what he sows\" could also be translated as, \"just like a certain kind of seed produces a certain kind of plant, in the same way a person's good actions will bring a good result and a person's evil actions will bring an evil result.\"\n\n(See also: [[:en:obe:kt:evil]], [[:en:obe:kt:good]], [[:en:obe:other:reap]])\n\n\n===== Bible References: =====\n\n{{door43pages @:en:bible:notes -r -q=\"\\{\\{tag>[^}]* sow(( )|(\\}))\" -exclude:home -simpleLineBreak -title -fontsize=\"100%\"}}~~DISCUSSION~~{{tag>publish}}",

It also means that he is always present.\n  * Following tradition, many Bible versions use the term \"LORD\" or \"the LORD\" to represent \"Yahweh.\" This tradition resulted from the fact that historically, the Jewish people became afraid of mispronouncing Yahweh's name and started saying \"Lord\" every time the term \"Yahweh\" appeared in the text. Modern Bibles write \"LORD\" with all capital letters to show respect for God's personal name and to distinguish it from \"Lord\" which is a different Hebrew word.\n  * The ULB and UDB texts always translate this term as, \"Yahweh,\" as it literally occurs in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.\n  * The term \"Yahweh\" does not ever occur in the original text of the New Testament; only the Greek term for \"Lord\" is used, even in quotes from the Old Testament.\n\n\n===== Translation Suggestions: =====\n\n  * \"Yahweh\" could be translated by a word or phrase that means \"I am\" or \"living one\" or \"the one who is\" or \"he who is alive.\"\n  * This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how \"Yahweh\" is spelled.\n  * Some church denominations prefer not to use the term \"Yahweh\" and instead use the traditional rendering, \"LORD.\" An important consideration is that this may be confusing when read aloud because it will sound the same as the title \"Lord.\" Some languages may have an affix or other grammatical marker that could be added to distinguish \"LORD\" as a name (Yahweh) from \"Lord\" as a title.\n\n(Translation suggestions: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names|How to Translate Names]])\n\n(See also: [[:en:obe:kt:god]], [[:en:obe:kt:lord]], [[:en:obe:kt:lordgod]], [[:en:obe:other:moses]],[[:en:obe:kt:reveal]])\n\n===== Bible References: =====\n\n{{door43pages @:en:bible:notes -r -q=\"\\{\\{tag>[^}]* yahweh(( )|(\\}))\" -exclude:home -simpleLineBreak -title -fontsize=\"100%\"}}\n\n\n===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====\n\n  * **[[:en:obs:notes:frames:09-14|[09-14]]]** God said, \"I AM WHO I AM.

Small amounts of dough from a previous batch of dough were saved as leavening for the next batch.\n  * When the Israelites escaped from Egypt, they didn't have time to wait for bread dough to rise, so they made bread without leaven to take with them on their journey. As a reminder of this, every year the Jewish people celebrate Passover by eating bread that has no leaven in it.\n  * The term \"leaven\" or \"yeast\" is used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of how sin spreads through a person's life or how sin can influence other people.\n  * It can also refer to false teaching which often spreads to many people and influences them.\n  * The term \"leaven\" is also used in a positive way to explain how the influence of God's kingdom spreads from person to person.\n\n===== Translation Suggestions =====\n\n  * This could be translated as \"leaven\" or \"substance that causes dough to rise\" or \"expanding agent.\" The word \"rise\" could be expressed as \"expand\" or \"get bigger\" or \"puff up.\"\n  * If a local leavening agent is used for making bread dough rise, that term can be used.
