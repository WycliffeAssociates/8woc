![Logo](https://unfoldingword.org/assets/img/icon-tc.png "translationCore")

Purpose
---
translationCore is an open source platform for checking and managing Bible translation projects. tC provides an extensible interface that enables, among other things, systematic and comprehensive checking of Bible translations against multiple sources and the original languages with just-in-time training modules that provide guidelines and instruction for translators.

Usage
---
Currently translationCore supports Bible Translation Projects started with [translationStudio](https://unfoldingword.org/ts/) and uploaded to [Door43](https://git.door43.org/), and with limited support for USFM projects created using other tools.

For more information see page for usage: [Usage](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationCore/wiki/Usage)

Contributions
---
We warmly welcome contributions to both the translationCore repository and building of new checking modules that fit the needs of the Global Church and Church Networks actively translating the Bible.
