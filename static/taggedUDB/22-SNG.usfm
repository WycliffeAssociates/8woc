\v 1 This is King Solomon's most beautiful song.
\b
\sp The young woman speaking to her lover
\q1
\v 2 Kiss me on my lips,
\q2 because your love for me is more delightful than wine.
\q1
\v 3 The fragrance of the perfume on your skin is very sweet.
\q2 And your honor is very great and is spreading,
\q2 like the fragrance of the special oil that you have put on your skin.
\q1 That is why the other young women are attracted to you.
\q1
\v 4 Take me quickly;
\q2 take me to your home.
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1 He is like a king to me;
\q2 he has brought me into his bedroom.

\s5
\v 5 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 I am dark but beautiful;
\q1 my dark skin is like the tents in Kedar,
\q2 or like the beautiful curtains in Solomon's palace.
\q1
\v 6 But do not stare at me because the sun has made my skin dark.
\q1 my brothers were angry with me,
\q1 so they forced me to work out in the sunshine in the vineyards,
\q2 so I was not able to take good care of my body.
\b
\sp The woman speaking to her lover
\q1

\s5
\v 7 You whom I love, where will you take your flock of sheep today?
\q2 Where will you allow them to rest at noontime?
\q1 I want to know because it is not right for me to wander around like a prostitute
\q2 looking for you among the flocks that belong to your friends.
\sp Her lover answering her
\q1

\s5
\v 8 You who are the most beautiful of all the women,
\q2 if you search for me and do not know where I will take my sheep,
\q1 follow the tracks of the sheep.
\q2 Then allow your young goats to graze near the shepherds' tents.
\b
\q1

\s5
\v 9 You are beautiful, my darling, like one of the young female horses
\q2 that pull the chariots belonging to the king of Egypt.
\q1
\v 10 Your cheeks are decorated with jewelry,
\q2 and there are strings of beads around your neck.
\q1
\v 11 I will make for you some gold earrings
\q2 that are decorated with silver.
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1

\s5
\v 12 While the king was on his couch,
\q2 the smell of my perfume spread around the room.

\v 17 Branches of cedar trees will shade us;
\q2 the fir branches overhead are like a roof for us.

\s5
\c 2
\sp The woman speaking to her lover
\q1
\v 1 I am like an insignificant flower in the plains,
\q2 like an insignificant lily growing in a valley.

\q1
\v 2 Among all the other young women,
\q2 you, the one whom I love, are like a lily growing among thorns!
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1

\s5
\v 3 Among all the other men, this man is the one who loves me; he is like a tree that grows in the forest.
\q2 Under his shade I am safe from the sun.
\q1 When he is close to me, it is like eating sweet fruit.
\q1
\v 4 He led me to the room where I feasted on his love,
\q2 where he made love to him, as if he were covering me with his love.
\sp The woman speaking to her lover
\q1

\s5
\v 5 Refresh me and strengthen me with your lovemaking.
\q2 It is like eating raisins and other fruit,
\q2 because I want you to love me even more.
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1
\v 6 I hope he puts his left arm under my head
\q2 and holds me close with his right arm.

\v 7 You young women of Jerusalem,

\q1 disturb us while we are making love
\q2 until we are ready to stop.
\b
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1

\s5
\v 8 I hear the voice of the man who loves me.
\q2 It is as though he is leaping over the mountains
\q1 and skipping over the hills
\q1
\v 9 like a deer or a gazelle.
\q2 Now he is standing outside the wall of our house,
\q1 looking in the window,
\q2 and peering through the lattice.
\q1

\s5
\v 10 He spoke to me and said,
\q2 "You whom I love, get up;
\q2 my beautiful one, come with me!
\q1
\v 11 Look, the winter has ended;
\q2 the rain has stopped.
\q1

\s5
\v 12 The flowers are blooming throughout the country.
\q2 It is now time to sing;
\q1 we hear the pigeons cooing.
\q1
\v 13 There are young figs on the fig trees,
\q2 and there are blossoms on the grapevines
\q1 and their fragrance fills the air.
\q2 You whom I love, get up;
\q2 my beautiful one, come with me!
\b
\q1

\s5
\v 14 You are like a dove hiding in the rocky cliff.
\q1 Show me your face,
\q2 and allow me to hear your voice,
\q2 because your voice is sounds sweet,
\q1 and your face is lovely."
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1

\s5
\v 15 There are other men who ruin women as wild dogs ruin vineyards;
\q2 do not allow those men to attack me.
\b
\q1

\s5
\v 16 This man who loves meâ€”I belong to him, and he belongs to me.
\q2 He takes great pleasure in kissing my lips,
\q2 as sheep love to graze in pastures.

\c 3
\sp The woman speaking to herself
\q1
\v 1 During the entire night while I lay on my bed,
\q2 I was longing to see the one I loved with all my heart.
\q1 I wanted him to come,
\q2 but he did not.
\q1
\v 2 So I said to myself,
\q1 "I will get up now and walk around the city,
\q2 through the streets and plazas,
\q2 to search for the one whom I love."
\q1 So I got up and went out to look for him,
\q2 but I could not find him.
\q1

\s5
\v 3 The city watchmen saw me
\q2 while they were patrolling in the city.
\q1 I asked them,
\q2 "Have you seen the one whom I love?"
\q1
\v 4 As soon as I walked past them,
\q2 I found the one whom I love with all my heart.
\q1 I clung to him and would not let him go
\q2 until I brought him to my mother's house,
\q2 to the room where my mother had conceived me.
\sp The woman speaking to the other women
\q1

\s5
\v 5 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 solemnly promise me, while the does and gazelles are listening, that you will not

\q1

\s5
\v 6 What is that I see coming from the wilderness,
\q2 something that is stirring up dust like a column of smoke
\q1 like some from burning myrrh and incense
\q2 made from spices imported by merchants?
\q1
\v 7 It is Solomon's litter carried by servants and
\q2 surrounded by sixty bodyguards
\q2 chosen from the strongest soldiers in Israel.
\q1

\s5
\v 8 They all have swords
\q2 and they all are trained to use them.
\q1 Each one has his sword strapped to his side
\q2 and is prepared for dangers that can happen during the night or day.
\q1
\v 9 King Solomon commanded his servants to make that litter for him;
\q2 it was made with wood from Lebanon.
\q1

\s5
\v 10 The canopy that covered it was held up by silver posts,
\q2 and the back of the litter was embroidered with gold.
\q1 The seat was covered with purple cloth
\q2 lovingly made by the women of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 11 You women of Jerusalem,
\q2 come and look at King Solomon
\q1 wearing the headdress that his mother put on his head
\q2 on the day when he was married,
\q1 the happiest day of his life.

\q1 Your long black hair moves from side to side like a flock of black goats
\q2 moving down the slopes of Mount Gilead.
\q1

\s5
\v 2 Your teeth are very white,
\q2 as white as sheep whose wool people have just cut,
\q1 as white as sheep that people have just washed in a stream.
\q1 You have all of your teeth on both sides;
\q2 none of them is missing.
\q1

\s5
\v 3 Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon,
\q2 and your mouth is lovely.

\q2 your cheeks are round and rosy like the halves of a pomegranate.
\q1

\s5
\v 4 Your long neck is beautiful, like the tower of King David
\q2 that was built using layers of stone.
\q1 The ornaments on the necklaces around your neck are like a thousand shields hanging on the walls of a tower;
\q2 each one belongs to a warrior.
\q1
\v 5 Your breasts are as delicate as two young twin deer
\q2 eating grass among lilies.
\q1

\s5
\v 6 Until dawn tomorrow morning,
\q2 when the nighttime shadows disappear,
\q1 I will lie close to your breasts, 
\q2 because they are like two hills that smell like sweet spices.
\q1
\v 7 My darling, you are completely beautiful;
\q2 your body is perfectly formed!
\b
\q1

\s5
\v 8 My darling, it is as though you were in Lebanon
\q2 far away, where I cannot reach you.
\q1 Come back to me.
\q1 It is as though you were on the top of Mount Hermon
\q2 or the nearby peaks, where I cannot go to you.
\q1 Come from the mountains, where the lions have their dens
\q2 and where the leopards live on the mountains.
\q1

\s5
\v 9 You who are most dear to me, when I see you,
\q2 you force me to love you
\q2 when I see you look at me, when I see a little of the jewelry that you wear around your neck.

\v 10 My bride, your love for me is delightful!
\q2 It more delightful than wine!
\q1 The fragrance of your perfume
\q2 is more pleasing than any spice!
\q1
\v 11 When you kiss me, it is better than when I eat honey.
\q2 Your kisses are as sweet as milk mixed with honey.
\q2 The aroma of your clothes
\q2 is like the aroma of cedar trees in Lebanon.
\q1

\s5
\v 12 You who are most dear to me, you are like a garden that the owner keeps locked
\q2 in order that other men cannot enter it;
\q1 you are like a spring that is covered
\q2 in order that others may not drink from it.
\q1
\v 13 You are like an orchard of pomegranate trees
\q2 full of delicious fruit,
\q2 and plenty of plants that produce henna and nard spices,
\q2
\v 14 saffron and calamus and cinnamon
\q2 and many other kinds of incense,
\q2 myrrh and aloes
\q2 and many other fine spices.

\sp The young woman speaking to her lover
\q1
\v 16 I want the north wind and the south wind to come,
\q2 and blow on my garden,
\q1 in order that the fragrance of the spices will spread through the air.

\q2 like someone comes into a garden and enjoys eating the fruit that grows there.

\s5
\c 5
\sp The woman's lover speaking to her
\q1
\v 1 You who are most dear to me,

\q2 In it I heard my lover knocking at the door.
\q1 He said, "You who are dearer to me than my sister, my darling, my dear friend, my perfect one, my dove,
\q2 open the door for me!
\q1 My hair is wet from the dew,
\q2 from the mist that has fallen during the night."
\q1

\s5
\v 3 But I had already taken off my robe;
\q2 I did not want to put it on again to open the door.
\q1 I had already washed my feet;
\q2 I did not want them to get dirty again.
\q1
\v 4 The one who loves me put his hand through the opening in the door,
\q2 and I was thrilled in my inner being that he was there.
\q1

\s5
\v 5 I got up to open the door for him,
\q2 but first I put a lot of myrrh on my hands.
\q1 It was dripping from my fingers
\q2 while I unlatched the bolt.
\q1

\s5
\v 6 I opened the door for the man who loves me,
\q2 but he left.
\q1 He had turned away and was gone!
\q2 I was very disappointed.
\q1 I searched for him, but I could not find him;
\q2 I called him, but he did not answer.
\q1

\s5
\v 7 The city watchmen saw me while they were walking around the city.
\q1 They beat me and wounded me
\q2 because they thought I was a prostitute;
\q2 those men who were guarding the city walls took my robe.

\s5
\v 8 You young women of Jerusalem,
\q2 I want you to take an oath

\sp The women of the city speaking to the young woman
\q1

\s5
\v 9 You who are the fairest among women,
\q2 why do you think that the one who loves you is better than other men?
\q1 In what way is he better than other men?
\q2 Why do you want us to swear that we will tell him that?
\sp The young woman speaking to the women of the city
\q1

\s5
\v 10 It is because the man who loves me is handsome and healthy,

\q1

\s5
\v 5 Stop looking at me like that,

\v 11 I went down to some walnut trees
\q2 to look at the new plants that were growing in the valley.

\q1
\v 12 I was as happy as if

\q2 to see if the grapevines have budded

\q1
\v 1 I wish that everyone knew that we love each other, just as they all know that I have a brother,

\q and no one would criticize me.
\q1

\s5
\v 2 No one would object if I led you to our mother's house,

\q2 we will decorate it by putting silver jewels that are like towers on her.
\q1 If she is as flat as a door,
\q2 we will decorate her with bits of cedar wood.
