# ransom #

## Definition: ##

The term "ransom" refers to a sum of money or other payment that is demanded or paid for the release of a person who is held captive.

* As a verb, "to ransom" means to make a payment or to do something self-sacrificially in order to rescue someone who has been captured, enslaved or imprisoned. This meaning of "buy back" is similar to the meaning of "redeem."
