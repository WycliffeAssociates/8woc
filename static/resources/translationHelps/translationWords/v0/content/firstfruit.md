# firstfruits #

## Definition: ##

The term "firstfruits" refers to a portion of the first crop of fruits and vegetables that was reaped during each harvest season.

* The Israelites offered these first fruits to God as a sacrificial offering.
* This term is also used figuratively in the Bible to refer to a firstborn son as being the first fruits of the family. That is, because he was the first son to be born into that family, he was the one who carried on the family name and honor.
* Because Jesus rose from the dead, he is called the "firstfruits" of all believers in him, belivers who have died but who will some day come back to life.
* Believers in Jesus are also called the "firstfruits" of all creation, indicating the special privilege and position of those whom Jesus redeemed and called to be his people.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* The literal use of this term could be translated as "first portion (of crops)" or "first part of the harvest."
* If possible, the figurative uses should be translated literally, to allow for different meanings in different contexts. This will also show the correlation between the literal meaning and the figurative uses.
