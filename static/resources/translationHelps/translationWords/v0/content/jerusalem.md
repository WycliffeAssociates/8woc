# Jerusalem #

## Facts: ##

Jerusalem was originally an ancient Canaanite city that later became the most important city in Israel. It is located about 34 kilometers west of the Salt Sea and just north of Bethlehem. It is still the capital city of present-day Israel.

* The name, "Jerusalem" is first mentioned in the book of Joshua. Other Old Testament names for this city include "Salem", "city of Jebus," and "Zion." Both "Jerusalem" and "Salem" have the root meaning of "peace."
* Jerusalem was originally a Jebusite fortress called "Zion" which King David captured and made into his capital city. 
* David's son Solomon built the first temple in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, which was the mountain where Abraham had offered his son Isaac to God. The temple was rebuilt there after it was destroyed by the Babylonians.
* Because the temple was in Jerusalem, the major Jewish festivals were celebrated there.
* People normally referred to going "up" to Jerusalem since it was located in the mountains.
