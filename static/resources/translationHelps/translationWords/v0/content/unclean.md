# unclean #

## Definition: ##	 

In the Bible, the term "â€‹unclean"â€‹ is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch, eat, or sacrifice.
 
* God gave the Israelites instructions about which animals were "â€‹clean"â€‹ and which ones were "â€‹unclean."â€‹ The unclean animals were not permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice.	 
* People with certain skin diseases were said to be "unclean" until they were healed.	 
* If the Israelites touched something "â€‹unclean,"â€‹ they themselves would be considered unclean for a certain period of time.	 
* Obeying God's commands about not touching or eating unclean things kept the Israelites set apart for God's service.	 
* This physical and ritual uncleanness was also symbolic of moral uncleanness.	 
* In another figurative sense, an "â€‹unclean spirit"â€‹ refers to an evil spirit.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* The term "unclean" could also be translated as "not clean" or "unfit in God's eyes" or "physically unclean" or "defiled."
* When referring to a demon as an unclean spirit, "unclean" could be translated as "evil" or "defiled."
* The translation of this term should allow for spiritual uncleanness. It should be able to refer to anything that God declared as unfit for touching, eating, or sacrifice.
