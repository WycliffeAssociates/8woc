The term "lord" refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people.

* This word is sometimes translated as "master" when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.
* Some English versions translate this as "sir" in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* This term can be translated with the equivalent of "master" when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It can also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.
* When it refers to Jesus, if the context shows that the speaker sees him as a religious teacher, it can be translated with a respectful address for a religious teacher, such as "master." 
* If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, "lord" could be translated with a respectful form of address such as "sir." This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.
* When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is considered a title, written as "Lord" (capitalized) in English.
