# Girgashites #

## Facts: ##

The Girgashites were a people group living near the Sea of Galilee in the land of Canaan. 

* They were descendants of Ham's son Canaan and so were one of the many people groups who were also known as "Canaanites."
* God promised the Israelites that he would help them defeat the Girgashites and other Canaanite people groups.
* Like all the Canaanite peoples, the Girgashites worshiped false gods and did immoral things as part of that worship.
