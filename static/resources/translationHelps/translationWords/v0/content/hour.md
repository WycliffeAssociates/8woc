# hour #

## Definition: ##

In addition to being used to refer to when or how long something took place, the term "hour" is also used in several figurative ways:

* Sometimes "hour" refers to a regular, scheduled time to do something, such as the "hour of prayer."
* When the text says that the "hour had come" for Jesus to suffer and be put to death, this means that it was the appointed time for this to happen--the time that God had selected long ago.
* The term "hour" is also used to mean "at that moment" or "right then."
* When the text talks about the "hour" being late, this means that it was late in the day, when the sun would soon be setting.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* When used figuratively, the term "hour" can be translated as "time" or "moment" or "appointed time."
* The phrase "in that very hour" or "the same hour" could be translated as "at that moment" or "at that time" or "immediately" or "right then."
* The expression "the hour was late" could be translated as "it was late in the day" or "it would soon be getting dark" or "it was late afternoon."
