# filled with the Spirit #

## Definition: ##

The term "filled with the Spirit" is a figurative expression that, when used to describe a person means the Holy Spirit is empowering that person to do God's will.

* The expression "filled with" is an expression that often means "controlled by."
* People are "filled with the Spirit" when they follow the Holy Spirit's leading and completely rely on him to help them do what God wants.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* This term could be translated as "empowered by the Holy Spirit" or "controlled by the Holy Spirit." But it should not sound as though the Holy Spirit is forcing the person to do something.
* A sentence such as "he was filled with the Spirit" could be translated as "he was living fully by the Spirit's power" or "he was completely guided by the Holy Spirit" or "the Holy Spirit was guiding him completely."
* This term is similar in meaning to the expression "live by the Spirit," but "filled with the Spirit" emphasizes the completeness with which a person allows the Holy Spirit to have control or influence over his life. So these two expressions should be translated differently, if possible.
