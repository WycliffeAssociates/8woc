The term "clean" literally means to not have any dirt or stain. In the Bible, it is often used figuratively to mean, "pure," "holy," or "free from sin."

Only the clean animals were permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice. In this context, the term "clean" means that the animal was acceptable to God for use as a sacrifice.
* A person who had certain skin diseases would be unclean until the skin was healed enough to no longer be contagious. Instructions for cleansing the skin had to be obeyed in order for that person to be declared "clean" again.
* Sometimes "clean" is used figuratively to refer to moral purity.
