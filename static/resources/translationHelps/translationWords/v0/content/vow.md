# vow #

## Definition: ##

A vow is a promise that a person makes to God. The person promises to do a certain thing in order to specially honor God or to show devotion to him.

* After a person makes a vow, he is obligated to fulfill that vow.
* The Bible teaches that a person may be judged by God if he doesn't keep his vow.
* Sometimes a person may ask God to protect him or provide for him in exchange for making the vow.
* But God is not required to fulfill a request that a person asks for in his vow.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Depending on the context, "vow" could be translated as "solemn promise" or "promise made to God."
* A vow is a special kind of oath that is made to God.
