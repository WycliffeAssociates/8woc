# amen, truly #

## Definition: ##

The term "amen" is a word used to emphasize or call attention to what a person has said. It is often used at the end of a prayer. Sometimes it is translated as "truly."

* When used at the end of a prayer, "amen" communicates agreement with the prayer or expresses a desire that the prayer be fulfilled.
* In his teaching, Jesus used "amen" to emphasize the truth of what he said. He often followed that by "and I say to you" to introduce another teaching that related to the previous teaching.
* When Jesus uses "amen" this way, some English versions (and the ULB) translate this as "verily" or  "truly."
* Another word meaning "truly" is sometimes translated as "surely" or "certainly" and is also used to emphasize what the speaker is saying.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* The phrase "truly, truly I tell you" could be translated as "I tell you this very sincerely" or "I tell you this very earnestly" or "what I am telling you is true."
