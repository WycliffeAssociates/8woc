# manna #

## Definition: ##

Manna was a white, grain-like food that God provided for the Israelites to eat during the 40 years of living in the wilderness after they left Egypt.

* Manna looked like white flakes which appeared each morning on the ground under the dew. It tasted sweet, like honey.
* The Israelites gathered the manna flakes every day except on the Sabbath.
* On the day before the Sabbath, God told the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna so they wouldn't have to gather it on their day of rest.
* The word "manna" means "what is it?"
* In the Bible, manna is also referred to as "bread from heaven" and "grain from heaven."
