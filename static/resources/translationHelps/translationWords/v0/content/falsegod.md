## Translation Suggestions: ##

* There may already be a word for "god" or "false god" in the language or in a nearby language.
* The term "idol" could be used to refer to false gods.
* In English, a lower case "g" is used to refer to false gods, and upper case "G" is used to refer to the one true God. Other languages also do that.
* Another option would be to use a completely different word to refer to the false gods.
* Some languages may add a word to specify whether the false god is described as male or female.
