The term "Savior" refers to a person who saves or rescues others from danger. It can also refer to someone who gives strength to others or provides for them.

* In the Old Testament, God is referred to as Israel's Savior because he often rescued them from their enemies, gave them strength, and provided them with what they needed to live.
* In the New Testament, "Savior" is used as a description or title for Jesus Christ because he saves people from being eternally punished for their sin. He also saves them from being controlled by their sin.
