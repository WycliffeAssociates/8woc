# God the Father, heavenly Father, Father #

## Facts: ##

The terms "God the Father" and "heavenly Father" refer to Yahweh, the one true God. Another term with the same meaning is "Father," used most often when Jesus was referring to him.

* God exists as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Each one is fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that mere humans cannot fully understand.
* God the Father sent God the Son (Jesus) into the world and he sends the Holy Spirit to his people.
* Anyone who believes in God the Son becomes a child of God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit comes to live in that person. This is another mystery that human beings cannot fully understand.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* In translating the phrase "God the Father," it is best to translate "Father" with the same word that the language naturally uses to refer to a human father.
* The term "heavenly Father" could be translated by "Father who lives in heaven" or "Father God who lives in heaven" or "God our Father from heaven."
* Usually "Father" is capitalized when it, refers to God.
