## Definition: ##

"Aram" is the name of two men in the Old Testament. It was also the name of a region northeast of Canaan, where modern-day Syria is located.

* The people living in Aram became known as "Arameans" and spoke "Aramaic." Jesus and other Jews of his time also spoke Aramaic.
* One of Shem's sons was named Aram. Another man named Aram was a cousin of Rebekah. It is probable that the region of Aram was named after one of these two men.
