# word, words #

## Definition: ##

A "word" refers to something that someone has said.

* An example of this would be when the angel told Zechariah, "You did not believe my words," which means, "You did not believe what I said."
* This term almost always refers to an entire message, not just one word.
* Sometimes "word" refers to speech in general, such as "powerful in word and deed" which means "powerful in speech and behavior."
* Often in the Bible "the word" refers to everything God has said or commanded, as in "the word of God" or "the word of truth."
* A very special use of this term is when Jesus is called "the Word." For these last two meanings, see [word of God](../kt/wordofgod.md)

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Different ways of translating "word" or "words" include "teaching" or "message" or "news" or "a saying" or "what was said."
