# I, Yahweh; me, Yahweh #

## Definition: ##

In the Old Testament, when God spoke about himself, he would often use his name instead of a pronoun.

* For example, instead of saying, "Honor me," he would say, "Honor Yahweh." 
* To make it clear that God is the one talking about himself, the ULB often translates this by adding a pronoun such as in, "Honor me, Yahweh" or "I, Yahweh say."
* By adding the pronoun "I" or "me," the ULB indicates to the reader that God is the speaker.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Some translators may decide it is natural and clear in their language to simply follow the literal text and use "Yahweh" with no pronoun added.
* Some may decide to use a pronoun with Yahweh only a few times at the beginning of a portion of text, but then omit the pronoun in the rest of that section. An ULB example of this is Deuteronomy 5:9-16.
* It is best if possible to keep the name Yahweh where it literally occurs in the text, but some translations may decide to use only a pronoun in some places, to make the text more natural and clear.
* This is a summary of possible ways to translate "Yahweh" when God is talking:
 * "Yahweh" (literal)        
 * "I, Yahweh" (or "me, Yahweh")
 * "I" (or "me") 
 * Introduce the quote with something like, "This is what Yahweh says."
* Another option would be to only add the pronoun occasionally, but not at every occurrence. 
* The translation of this phrase should sound natural in the language and should make it clear that Yahweh is talking about himself.
