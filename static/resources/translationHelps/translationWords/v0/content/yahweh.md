# Yahweh #

## Facts: ##

The term "Yahweh" is God's personal name that he revealed when he spoke to Moses at the burning bush. 

* The name "Yahweh" comes from the word that means, "to be" or "to exist."
* Possible meanings of "Yahweh" include, "he is" or "I am" or "the one who causes to be."
* This name reveals that God has always lived and will continue to live forever. It also means that he is always present.
* Following tradition, many Bible versions use the term "LORD" or "the LORD" to represent "Yahweh." This tradition resulted from the fact that historically, the Jewish people became afraid of mispronouncing Yahweh's name and started saying "Lord" every time the term "Yahweh" appeared in the text. Modern Bibles write "LORD" with all capital letters to show respect for God's personal name and to distinguish it from "Lord" which is a different Hebrew word.
* The ULB and UDB texts always translates this term as, "Yahweh," as it literally occurs in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.
* The term "Yahweh" does not ever occur in the original text of the New Testament; only the Greek term for "Lord" is used, even in quotes from the Old Testament.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* "Yahweh" could be translated by a word or phrase that means "I am" or "living one" or "the one who is" or "he who is alive."
* This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how "Yahweh" is spelled.
* Some church denominations prefer not to use the term "Yahweh" and instead use the traditional rendering, "LORD." An important consideration is that this may be confusing when read aloud because it will sound the same as the title "Lord." Some languages may have an affix or other grammatical marker that could be added to distinguish "LORD" as a name (Yahweh) from "Lord" as a title.
