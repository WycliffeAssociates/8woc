Hendiadys is when a speaker makes a single idea more forceful by connecting two nouns or adjectives with "and" when one of the words actually describes the other.

### Description

Hendiadys is when a speaker expresses a single idea by connecting two words with "and" when one of the words actually describes the other.
>his own __kingdom and glory__ (1 Thessalonians 2:12 ULB)

Though "kingdom" and "glory" are both nouns, "glory" actually tells what kind of kingdom it is: it is a kingdom of glory or a glorious kingdom.

#### Reasons this is a translation issue

  * Often hendiadys has an abstract noun. Some languages may not have a noun with the same meaning.
  * Some languages do not use hendiadys, so people may not understand that one word describes the other. 

### Examples from the Bible

>for I will give you __words and wisdom__ (Luke 21:15 ULB)

"Words" and "wisdom" are nouns, but in this figure of speech "wisdom" describes "words."
>if you are willing and obedient (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)

"Willing" and "obedient" are adjectives, but "willing" describes "obedient."

### Translation Strategies

If the hendiadys would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:

  1. Substitute one noun with an adjective that means the same thing.
  1. Substitute one noun with a phrase that means the same thing.
  1. Substitute one adjective with an adverb that means the same thing. 
  1. Substitute other parts of speech that mean the same thing and show that one word describes the other.
