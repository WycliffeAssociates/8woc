==== Description =====

Sometimes immediately after the bolded words and hyphen there is a phrase in double quotation marks. This phrase means the same as the bolded words from the ULB and it can replace it in your translation. It may clarify who or what a pronoun refers to, or it may use words that you understand better. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> 'Make ready __the way__ of the Lord, (Luke 3:4 ULB)
  * **the way**  - "the path" or "the road"

In this example, the words "the path" or the words "the road" can replace the words "the way" in the ULB. You can decide whether it is natural to say "way," "path," or "road" in your language.

> whoever has food should __do likewise__." (Luke 3:10 ULB)
  * **do likewise**  - "do the same thing" 

In this example, the words "do the same thing" can replace the words "do likewise" in the ULB. You, as the translator, can decide what is natural for your language.
