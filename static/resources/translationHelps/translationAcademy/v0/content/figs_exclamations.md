### Description 

Exclamations are words or sentences that show strong feeling such as surprise, joy, fear, or anger. In the ULB and UDB, they usually have an exclamation mark (!) at the end. The mark shows that it is an exclamation. The situation and the meaning of what the people say helps us understand what feelings they were expressing. In the example below from Matthew 8, the speakers were terribly afraid. In the example from Matthew 9, the speakers were amazed, because something happened that they had never seen before.

>Save us, Lord; we are about to die! (Matthew 8:25 ULB)


>When the demon had been driven out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were astonished and said, "This has never been seen before in Israel!"  (Matthew 9:33 ULB)

**Reason this is a translation issue**: Languages have different ways of showing that a sentence shows strong emotion.

#### Examples from the Bible 

Some exclamations have a word that shows feeling. The sentences below have "Oh" and "Ah." The word "oh" here shows the speaker's amazement. 

>__Oh__, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

The word "Ah" below shows that Gideon was very frightened. 
>Gideon understood that this was the angel of Yahweh. Gideon said, "__Ah__, Lord Yahweh! For I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!" (Judges 6:22 ULB)

Some exclamations start with a question word such as "how" or "why," even though they are not questions. The sentence below shows that the speaker is amazed at how unsearchable God's judgments are.

>__How__ unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering! (Romans 11:33 ULB)

Some exclamations in the Bible do not have a main verb. The exclamation below shows that the speaker is disgusted with the person he is speaking to.

>You worthless person! (Matthew 5:22 ULB)
