When people tell a story, they normally tell the events in the order that they happened. Sometimes a writer may give some background information to help his listeners understand the story. The background information might be about things that happened before the events he has already told about, or it might explain something in the story, or it might be about something that would happen much later in the story. The story teller and translator need to tell the story in a way that people will know whether an event is background information and will be able to understand what order the events happened in.

### Description

Every story has a storyline. The storyline tells a series of events mostly in the time order that the events happened. It is full of action verbs that moves the reader along the storyline. Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break is called **background information.**  The underlined sentences in the story below are all background information.

Peter and John went on a hunting trip because __their village was going to have a a feast the next day__. __Peter was the best hunter in the village.__ __He once killed three wild pigs in one day!__ They walked for hours through low bushes until they found  a wild pig. They shot the pig and killed it. Then they tied up its legs with some rope __they had brought with them__, and carried it home on a pole. When they brought it to the village, Peter's cousin saw the pig and realized that __it was his own pig__. __Peter had mistakenly killed his cousin's pig__.

Often background information uses "be" verbs like "was" and "were", rather than action verbs. Examples of these are "Peter __was__ the best hunter in the village" and "it __was__ his own pig."

Sometimes a storyteller makes a break in the story to tell about something that had happened earlier or something that would happen much later. Examples of these are "their village was going to have a a feast the next day" and "He once killed three wild pigs in one day," "that they had brought with them," and "Peter had mistakenly killed his cousins's pig.

#### A writer may use background information

  * to help their listeners be interested in the story.
  * to help their listeners understand something in the story.
  * to help the listeners understand why something is important in the story.
  * to tell the setting of a story. Setting includes:
     * where the story takes place.
     * when the story takes place.
     * who is present when the story begins.
     * what is happening when the story begins.

#### Reasons this is a translation issue

  * Translators need to know whether or not the events in the Bible happened in the same order that they are told. 
  * Translators will need to translate the story in a way that their own readers will understand the order of events. 

### Examples from the Bible

>Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. Abram __was__ eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.  (Genesis 16:16 ULB)

The first sentence tells about two events. Hagar gave birth and Abraham named his son. The second sentence is background information about how old Abram was when those things happened.

>Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, __was__ about thirty years of age. He __was__ the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.   (Luke 3:23 ULB) 

The verses before this tell about when Jesus was baptized. This sentence introduces background information about Jesus' age and ancestors. The story starts up again in chapter 4 where it tells about Jesus going to the wilderness.

>Now it happened on a Sabbath that Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them between their hands, and eating the grain. But some of the Pharisees said... (Luke 6:1-2a ULB)

These verses give the setting of the story. The events took place in a grain field on the Sabbath day. Jesus, his disciples, and some Pharisees were there, and Jesus' disciples were picking heads of grain and eating them. The main action in the story starts with the sentence "But some of the Pharisees said."

### Translation Strategies

To keep translations clear and natural you will need to study the grammar and punctuation of your language. Observe how your language presents background information in writings. Follow those same grammar rules when you translate.

  1. Use your language's way of showing that certain information is background information.
  1. Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first.  (This is not always possible when the background information is very long.)

### Examples of Translation Strategies applied

1. Use your language's way of showing that certain information is background information. The examples below explain how this was done in the ULB English translations.

  * **Now Jesus himself, when he began to teach, __was__ about thirty years of age. He __was__ the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.** (Luke 3:23 ULB) - English uses the word "now" to show that there is some kind of change in the story. The verb "was" shows that it is background information.


  * **With many other exhortations also, he preached good news to the people. John also rebuked Herod the tetrarch __for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias__, and __for all the other evil things that Herod had done__. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.**  (Luke 3:18-20 ULB) The underlined phrases happened before John rebuked Herod. In English, the helping verb "had" in "had done" shows that Herod did those things before John rebuked him.

2. Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first. 

  * **Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. __Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram__.** (Genesis 16:16 ULB)
      * "__When Abram was eighty-six years old__, Hagar gave birth to his son, and Abram named his son Ishmael." 

  * **John also rebuked Herod the tetrarch __for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias__, and __for all the other evil things that Herod had done__. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.**  (Luke 3:18-20) -  The translation below reorders John's rebuke and Herod's actions. 
      * "Now Herod the tetrarch married his brother's wife, Herodias, and he did many other evil things, so John rebuked him. But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison."
