==== To Translate from the ULB ====

  * Read the ULB. Do you understand the meaning of the text so that you can accurately, clearly and naturally translate the meaning into your language?
    * YES? Start translating.
  * NO? Look at the UDB. Does the UDB help you understand the meaning of the ULB text?
    * YES? Start translating.
  * NO? Read the translation notes for help.
Translation Notes are words or phrases copied from the ULB and then explained. In English, every note that explains the ULB starts the same. There is a bullet point, the ULB text is in bold followed by a dash, and then there are translation suggestions or information for the translator. For example:
  * **copied ULB text**  - translation suggestion or information for the translator
There are many different type of notes in the Translation Notes. Each type of note gives the explanation in a different way. Knowing the type of note will help the translator make decisions on the best way to translate the Bible text into their language.
  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_def]]** - Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format.

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_eplain]]** - Simple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format. 

==== Suggested Translations ====

There are several types of suggested translations.
  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_synequi]]** - There are times that the notes provide a translation suggestion that can replace the word or phrases in the ULB. These replacements can fit into the sentence without changing the meaning of the sentence. These are synonyms and equivalent phrases and are written in double-quotes. These mean the same as the text in the ULB. 

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_alter]]** - An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language has a different form. The alternate translation should only be used when the ULB form or content will not fit into the form of your language. 

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_clarify]]** - There may be no note if the UDB provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion there may be text from the UDB as well as a suggested translation. There will be "(UDB)" after the text from the UDB.

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_alterm]]** - Alternate meanings refer to when there are multiple ways to express something or when there are different understandings of what the word or phrase means. 

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_porp]]** - Sometimes Bible scholars do not know for sure, or do not agree on, what a particular phrase or sentence in the Bible means. Some reasons for this include: there are minor differences in the ancient Bible texts, or a word may have more than one meaning or use, or it may not be clear what a word (such as a pronoun) refers to in a particular phrase. 

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_fofs]]** - In the notes there will be an explanation on how to translate the Figure of Speech that is in the passage. Sometimes an Alternate Translation (AT:) is provided. There will also be a link to the translationAcademy page for additional information and translation strategies to help the translator accurately translate for the meaning of the passage. 

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_iordquote]]** - There are two kinds of quotations: direct quotation and indirect quotation. When translating a quotation, translators need to decide whether to translate it as a direct quotation or an indirect quotation.

  * **[[en:ta:vol1:translate:resources_long]]** - Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts afterward. The longer phrase is broken down so that translation suggestions for parts of the phrase can be explained for each part.
