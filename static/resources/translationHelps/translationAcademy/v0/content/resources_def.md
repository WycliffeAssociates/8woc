==== Description =====

Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. The notes may have a definition or a description of the word or phrase to help you understand what it means. 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:
> It is like children playing in the __marketplace__, who sit and call to one another and say, 'We played a __flute__ for you (Matthew 11:16-17 ULB)

  * **marketplace**  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods
  * **flute**  - a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end 

> people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in __kings' palaces__ (Luke 7:25 ULB)

  * **kings' palaces**  - a large, expensive house that a king lives in

==== Translation Principles ====  

  * Use words that are already part of your language if possible.
  * Keep expressions short if possible.
  * Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.
