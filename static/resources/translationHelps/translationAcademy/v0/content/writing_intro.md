Writing styles is also called 'Discourse.' It refers to how the parts of a text are organized and connected in order to communicate the author's meaning. In every translation, the way that words, sentences, and paragraphs are arranged will affect how people will understand the message.

### Kinds of Writing Styles:

The following are four basic writing styles based on the kind of information they give.

  * **Narrative**  or **[Parables](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_parables.md)**- tells a story or event
  * **Explanatory**  - explains facts or teaches principles
  * **Procedural**  - tells how to do something
  * **Argumentative**  - tries to persuade someone to do something

The following writing styles often present challenges in translation. 

  * **[Poetry](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_poetry.md)**- expresses ideas and feelings in a beautiful way
  * **[Proverbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_proverbs.md)**- briefly teaches a truth or wisdom
  *  **[Symbolic Language](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_symlanguage.md)** - uses symbols to represent things and events  
  *  **[Symbolic Prophecy](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_apocalypticwriting.md)** - uses symbolic language to show what will happen in the future  
  *  **[Hypothetical Situations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_hypo.md)** - tells about what would happen if something were real or expresses an emotion about something that is not real.  

The purpose of a particular text will influence what kinds of discourse features are used. For example, in a narrative, discourse features would include:

  * telling about events that happen before and after other events;
  * introducing people in the story;
  * introducing new events in the story;
  * conversation and the use of quotes;
  * referring to people and things with nouns or pronouns.

Languages have organized ways of communicating information in each of these discourse types.

### Specific discourse issues:

  1. **[Introduction of a New Event](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_newevent.md)**- Phrases like "One day" or "It came about that" or "This is how it happened" or "Sometime after that" signal to the reader that a new event is about to be told.
  1. **[Introduction of New and Old Participants](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_participants.md)**- Languages have ways of introducing new people and of referring to those people again.
  1. **[Background Information](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_background.md)**- An author may use background information for several reasons: 1) to add interest to the story, 2) to provide important historical or cultural information or 3) to tell the reader, or listener, something very important.
  1. **[Pronouns - When to Use Them](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_pronouns.md)**  - Languages have patterns for how frequently to use pronouns. If that pattern is not followed, wrong meaning can result.
  2. **[End of Story](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_endofstory.md)** - Stories can end with various kinds of information. Languages have different ways of showing how that information is related to the story. 
  1. **[Quotations and Quote Margins](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_quotations.md)**- Languages have different ways of reporting what someone said.
  1. **[Connecting Words](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_connectingwords.md)**- Languages have patterns for how to use connecting words (such as "and," "but," or "then").
