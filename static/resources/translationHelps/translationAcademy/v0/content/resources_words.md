==== translationWords ====

It is the duty of the translator, to the best of his ability, to make sure that each Bible passage he translates has the meaning that the writer of that Bible passage intended it to communicate. In order to do this, he will need to study translation helps prepared by Bible scholars, including the translationWords resource. 

In order to use translationWords, follow these steps:
  - Identify the important words and any words in the source text that are ambiguous or difficult to understand.
  - Look at the section called "translationWords."
  - Find the words that you identified as important or difficult, and click on the first one
  - Read the translationWords entry for that word
  - After reading all of the definitions, read the Bible passage again, thinking about the definition that you read in translationWords.
  - Compare the word with other words of similar meaning.
  - Think of possible ways to translate the term. Choose one to try.
  - Test the term you have chosen to see if others understand the meaning.
  - Do the same for each word that you identified.

Once you have found a good translation for a translationWord, you should use it consistently throughout the translation. If you find a place where that translation does not fit, then think through the process again. It could be that a word with similar meaning will fit better in the new context. Keep track of which word or words you are using to translate each translationWord.

=== Unknown Ideas ===

Sometimes a translationWord refers to a thing or custom that is unknown in the target language. Possible solutions are to use a descriptive phrase, substitute something similar, use a foreign word from another language, use a more general word or use more specific words. See the lesson on [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]] for more information.

One kind of 'unknown idea' are words that refer to Jewish and Christian religious customs and beliefs. Some common unknown ideas are:

**Names of places** such as:
  * Temple (a building where the Israelites offered sacrifices to God)
  * Synagogue (a building where Jewish people assemble to worship God)
  * Sacrificial alter (a raised structure on which sacrifices were burned as gifts, or offerings, to God.)
**Titles of people who hold an office** such as:
  * Priest (someone who is chosen to relate to God on behalf of his people)
  * Pharisee (important group of Israel's religious leaders in Jesus' time)
  * Prophet (person who speaks God's messages to people)
  * Son of Man
  * Son of God
  * King (ruler of an independent city, state or country).
**Key Biblical Concepts** such as:
  * Forgiveness (to not resent that person and not be angry at him for doing something hurtful)
  * Salvation (being saved or rescued from evil, enemies, or from danger)
  * Redemption (the act of buying back something that was previously owned or that was held captive)
  * Mercy (helping people who are in need)
  * Grace (help or regard that is given to someone who has not earned it).

You may need to discuss the definitions of these translationWords with other members of the translation team or people from your church or village in order to discover the best way to translate them.
