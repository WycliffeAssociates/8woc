Many times in the Bible adjectives are used as nouns to describe a group of people.

### Description

In some languages an adjective can be used to refer to a class of things that the adjective describes. When it does, it acts like a noun. For example, the word "rich" is an adjective. Here are two sentences that show that "rich" is an adjective.
> __The rich man__ had huge numbers of flocks and herds, (2 Samuel 12:2 ULB)

The adjective "rich" comes before the word "man" and describes "man."
>__He will not be rich__; his wealth will not last; (Job 15:29 ULB)

The adjective "rich" comes after the verb "be" and describes "He."
>â€¦__the rich__ must not give more than the half shekel, and __the poor__ must not give less.  (Exodus 30:15 ULB)

In Exodus 30:15, the word "rich" acts as a noun in the phrase "the rich," and it refers to rich people. The word "poor" also acts as a noun and refers to poor people.

#### Reason this is a translation issue

  * Some languages do not use adjectives this way.
  * Readers may think that the text is talking about one particular person when it is really talking about many people whom the adjective describes.

### Examples from the Bible

>The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of __the righteous__.  (Psalms 125:3 ULB)

"The righteous" here are people who are righteous, not one particular righteous person.
>Blessed are __the meek__ (Matthew 5:5 ULB) 

"The meek" here are people who are meek, not one particular meek person.

### Translation Strategies

If your language uses adjectives as nouns to refer to a class of people, consider using the adjectives this way. If it would sound strange, or if the meaning would be unclear or wrong, here is another option:

  1. Use the adjective with a plural form of the noun that the adjective describes.

### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied

1. Use the adjective with a plural form of the noun that the adjective describes.

  * **The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of __the righteous__.**  (Psalms 125:3 ULB)
      * "The scepter of wickedness must not rule in the land of __righteous people__."

  * **Blessed are __the meek__** (Matthew 5:5 ULB)
      * "Blessed are __people who are meek__"
