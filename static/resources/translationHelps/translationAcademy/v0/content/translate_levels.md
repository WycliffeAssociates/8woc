==== Levels of Meaning ====

A good translation requires that the meaning be the same in the target language as in the source language.

There are many different levels of meaning in the Bible. These levels include: 
  * Meaning of words
  * Meaning of phrases
  * Meaning of sentences
  * Meaning of paragraphs
  * Meaning of chapters
  * Meaning of books

==== Words Have Meaning ====

That is, even the smallest unit, a word, has a meaning. But this meaning is determined by the context that the word is in. For example, a single word like "give" may have the following possible meanings, depending on the context:
  * to grant a gift
  * to collapse or break
  * to surrender
  * to quit
  * to concede
  * to supply
  * etc.

==== Building the Larger Meaning ====

The translator must determine what each word means in the context, and then reproduce the same meaning in the translated text. These words then combine into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Therefore, the translator must also make sure that the words fit together into equivalent phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. so that the translated text has the same meaning on each level.
