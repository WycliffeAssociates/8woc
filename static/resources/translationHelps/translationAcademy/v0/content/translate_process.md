==== How to Translate ====

There are two things to do in translation:
  - Discover the meaning in the source language text (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_discover]])
  - Re-tell the meaning in the target language translation (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_retell]])
Instructions for translation sometimes divide these two things into smaller steps. The graphic below shows how these two fit into the translation process.
