The Bible is made up of 66 books. It has two main parts. The first part was written first and is called the Old Testament. The second part was written later and is called the New Testament. The Old Testament has 39 books and the New Testament has 27 books. (Some of the books in the New Testament are letters to people.)

Each book is divided up into chapters. Most books have more than one chapter, but Philemon, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude each have only one chapter. All the chapters are divided up into verses. 

When we want to refer to a verse, we first write the name of the book, then the chapter, and then the verse. For example "John 3:16" means John, chapter 3, verse 16.

When we refer to two or more verses that are next to each other, we put a line between them. "John 3:16-18" means John, chapter 3, verses 16, 17, and 18.

When we refer to verses that are not next to each other, we use commas to separate them. "John 3:2, 6, 9" means John chapter 3, verses 2, 6, and 9.

In translationAcademy we tell where portions of scripture come from. However, this does not mean that the whole verse or set of verses is shown. The text below comes from Judges, chapter 6, verse 28, but it is not the whole verse. The verse has more at the end.
