 The Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. These languages have a **singular** form of "you" for when the word "you" refers to just one person, and a **plural** form for when the word "you" refers to more than one person. However sometimes speakers in the Bible used the **singular** form of "you" even though they were speaking to a group of people.

### Description

Sometimes people in the Bible used the singular form of "you" even though they were speaking to more than one person. This is not obvious when you read the Bible in English, because English does not have distinct forms for "you" singular and "you" plural. But you may see this if you read a Bible in a language that does have distinct forms. 

#### Reason this is a Translation Issue

  * When a translator reads a Bible with "you" singular, he needs to know whether the speaker was speaking to one person or more than one.
  * In some languages it might be confusing if a speaker uses the "you" singular when speaking to more than one person.

### Examples from the Bible

><sup>1</sup>Take heed that you do not do your acts of righteousness before people to be seen by them, or else you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. <sup>2</sup>So when __you__ give alms, do not sound a trumpet before __yourself__ as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have the praise of people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward. (Matthew 6:1,2 ULB)

Jesus said this to a crowd. He used "you" plural in verse 1, and "you" singular in the first sentence of verse 2. Then in the last sentence he used the plural again. 
>God spoke all these words: "I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You must have no other gods before me." (Exodus 20:1-3 ULB)

God said this to the people of Israel. He had taken them all out of Egypt and he wanted them all to obey him, but he used the the singular form of "you" here when speaking to them.

#### Translation Strategies

  1. If the singular form of "you" would be natural when speaking to a group, consider using it.
    1. Whether you can use it may depend on who the speaker is and who his listeners are.
    1. It may also depend on what the speaker is saying.
  1. If the singular form of "you" would not be natural when speaking to a group, or if the readers would be confused by it, use the plural form of "you."
