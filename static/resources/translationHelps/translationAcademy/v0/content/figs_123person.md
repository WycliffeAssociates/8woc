Normally a speaker refers to himself as "I" and the person he is speaking to as "you." Sometimes in the Bible a speaker referred to himself or to the person he was speaking to with a phrase other than "I" or "you". 

### Description

  * **First person** - This is how a speaker normally refers to himself.  English uses the pronouns "I" and "we". (Also: me, my, mine; us, our, ours)
  * **Second person** - This is how a speaker normally refers to the person or people he is speaking to. English uses  the pronoun "you." (Also: your, yours)
  * **Third person** - This is how a speaker refers to someone else. English uses the pronouns "he," "she," "it" and "they." (Also: him, his, her, hers, its; them, their, theirs) Noun phrases like "the man" or "the woman" are also third person.

Sometimes in the Bible a speaker used the third person to refer to himself or the people he was speaking to. Readers might think that the speaker was referring to someone else. They might not understand that he meant "I" or "you."

### Examples from the Bible

Sometimes people uses the third person instead of "I" or "me" to refer to themselves.
>But David said to Saul, "__Your servant__ used to keep __his__ father"s sheep." (1 Samuel 17:34 ULB)

David referred to himself in the third person as "your servant" and "his." He was calling himself Saul's servant in order to show his humility before Saul.

>Then Yahweh answered Job out of a fierce storm and said,  
>"… Do you have an arm like __God's__? Can you thunder with a voice like __him__? (Job 40:6, 9 ULB)

God referred to himself in the third person with the words "God's" and "him." He did this to emphasize that he is God, and he is powerful.
Sometimes people use the third person instead of "you" or "your" to refer to the person or people they are speaking to.
>Abraham answered and said, "Look what I have done, taking it upon myself to speak to __my Lord__, even though I am only dust and ashes! (Genesis 18:27 ULB)

Abraham was speaking to the Lord, and referred to the Lord as "My Lord" rather than as "you." He did this to show his humility before God.
>So also my heavenly Father will do to you, if __each of you__ does not forgive __his__ brother from your heart. (Matthew 18:35 ULB)

After saying "each of you," Jesus used the third person "his" instead of "your."
