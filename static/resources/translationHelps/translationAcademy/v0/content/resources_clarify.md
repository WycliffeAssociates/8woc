==== Description ====

There may not be a note if the Unlocked Dynamic Bible provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion a note may include text from the UDB as a suggested translation. In that case the text from the UDB will be followed by "(UDB)." 

==== Translation Notes Examples ====

> they implored him to stay with them (John 4:40 **ULB**)

> they urged him to stay a longer time with them (John 4:40 **UDB**)

  * **implored him**  - "begged him" or "urged him" (UDB)
Here the suggested translation for the words 'implored him' is 'begged him.' The words, 'urged him' from the UDB mean the same thing and are included as another suggestion.

> When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face (Luke 5:12 **ULB**)

> When he saw Jesus, he bowed down to the ground (Luke 5:12 **UDB**)

  * **he fell on his face** - "he knelt and touched the ground with his face" or "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB)
Here the words from the UDB are provided as another translation suggestion.
