==== What Should I Translate First? ====

At some point, the translation team will have to figure out what they should translate first, or, if they have already done some translation, what they should translate next. There are several factors that need to be considered: 
  * What does the church want to be translated? 
  * How experienced is the translation team? 
  * How much Biblical content has been translated into this language?

The answers to these questions are all important. But remember this:

>Translation is a skill that grows with experience.

Because translation is a skill that grows, it is wise to start translating content that is less complicated so that the translators can learn the skill while translating something simple. 

==== Translation Difficulty ====

Wycliffe Bible Translators have rated the difficulty of translating the different books of the Bible. In their rating system, the most complicated books to translate receive a level 5 difficulty. The easiest books to translate are a level 1. 

In general, books that have more abstract, poetic, and theologically loaded terms and ideas are more difficult to translate. Books that are more narrative and concrete are generally easier to translate.

==== Open Bible Stories ====

Though Open Bible Stories was not assessed according to this rating system, we think that it would fall under Difficulty Level 1. It was intentionally created for easy translation; many of the difficult theological and linguistic parts were greatly simplified in order to help the translators. 

We recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. There are many good reasons to start by translating Open Bible Stories:
  * Open Bible Stories was designed to be easily translated
    * It is largely narrative
    * Many difficult phrases and words have been substituted with words that are easier to translate
    * It has many pictures to help the translator understand the text
  * Open Bible Stories is much shorter than the Bible or even the New Testament, so it can be quickly completed and distributed to the Church
  * Since it is not Scripture, Open Bible Stories removes the fear that many translators have of translating the Word of God
  * Translating Open Bible Stories before translating the Bible gives the translators experience and training in translation, so that when they translate the 
  Bible, they will do it well
    * Experience in creating a translation and checking team
    * Experience in doing the translation and checking process
    * Experience in using the unfoldingWord translation tools
    * Experience in resolving translation conflicts
    * Experience in getting church and community participation
    * Experience in publishing and distributing content
  * Open Bible Stories is a great tool to teach the church, evangelize the lost, and train the translators in what the Bible is all about

You can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found Story #31 (see https://door43.org/en/obs/31 ) is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.

==== Conclusion ====

Ultimately, the church needs to decide what they want to translate, and in what order. But because translation is a skill that improves with use, and because the translation and checking teams can learn so much about translating the Bible by translating Open Bible Stories, and because of the immense value that the translated Open Bible Stories gives to the local church, we highly recommend starting your translation project with Open Bible Stories. 

After translating Open Bible Stories, we recommend working through some of the Difficulty Level 2 and 3 books (like Ruth and Mark). Finally, after the translation team has a lot of experience, then they can start translating Difficulty Level 4 and 5 books (like John, Hebrews, and Psalms). If the translation team follows this schedule, they will make better translations with far fewer mistakes.
