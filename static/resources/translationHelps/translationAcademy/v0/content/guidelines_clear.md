==== Clear Translations ====

A clear translation will use whatever language structures are necessary to help the readers to most easily read and understand it. This includes putting the text into a different form or arrangement and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible. 

Here are some ideas to create a clear translation from the source text into your language:
  * Check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.
  * Understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.
  * You may need to change each **event** idea into an active clause if it is in some other form, such as an abstract noun.
  * You may need to change passive verbs to the active form.
  * Look at each "of" phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by "of."

=== Check Pronouns ===

You will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.

Always check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.

=== Identify Participants ===

Next you need to understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the **participants**. The **participants** in an event are the people or things that take part in that event. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it are the main **participants**. When re-expressing an **event** idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the **participants** in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.

=== Clearly Express Event Ideas ===

A clear translation may need to express **event**ideas as verbs. You may need to change each **event** idea into an active clause to be sure it is understood. 

When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any **event** ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the **event** idea. If, however, your language also uses nouns to express **event** ideas and the event or action sounds more natural as a noun, then use the noun form.

=== Passive Verbs ===

A clear translation may need to change any **passive** verbs to the **active** form.

In the **active** form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the **passive** form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. For example, "John hit Bill" is an active sentence. "Bill was hit by John" is a passive sentence.

Many languages do not have a **passive** form, only the **active** form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the **passive** form into the **active** form.

=== Look at Each 'Of' Phrase ===

To make a clear translation, you will also need to look at each "of" phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by "of." In many languages, "of" constructions are not as frequent as they are in Greek, the original language of the New Testament books. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.

After you have checked these things and made your translation as clear as possible, you will need to read it to other people who speak your language to see if it is clear to them. If there are parts that they do not understand, it may be because that part is not clear. Together, you can think of a clearer way to say that part. Keep checking the translation with many people until all of it is clear.

Remember: Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.

=== Writing Clearly ===

Also ask yourself the following questions:
  * Have you effectively used punctuation to help a reader know when to pause or to breathe?  
  * Have you indicated which parts are direct speech?  
  * Are you separating paragraphs?
  * Have you followed the verse numbering of your source text and included it in your translation?

These points are also important in keeping a translation clear and easy to read.
