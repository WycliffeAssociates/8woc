A parable is a short story that makes truth easy to understand and hard to forget.

==== Description ====

A parable is a short story that is told to teach a truth. Though the events in a parable could happen, they did not actually happen. They are told only to teach a truth. Parables rarely contain the names of specific people. (This may help you identify what is a parable and what is an account of a real event.) Parables often have figures of speech such as simile and metaphor. 
>Then he also told them a parable. "Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not?" (Luke 6:39 ULB)
This parable teaches that if a person does not have spiritual understanding, he cannot help someone else to understand spiritual things. 

==== Examples from the Bible ==== 

>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather, on the lampstand, and it shines for everyone in the house. Let your light shine before people in such a way that they see your good deeds and praise your Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 5:15-16 ULB)
This parable teaches us not to hide the way we live for God from other people.    
>Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field. This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches." (Matthew 13:31-32 ULB)
This parable teaches that the kingdom of God may seem small at first, but it will grow and spread throughout the world.

==== Translation Strategies ====

  - If a parable is hard to understand because it has unknown things in it, you can replace the unknown things with things that people in your culture know. However, be careful to keep the teaching the same. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  - If the teaching of the parable is unclear, consider telling a little about what it teaches in the introduction, such as "Jesus told this story about being generous."

1. If a parable is hard to understand because it has unknown things in it, you can replace the unknown things with things that people in your culture know. However, be careful to keep the teaching the same. 
  * **Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a __lampstand__"**. (Mark 4:21 ULB) - If people do not know what a lampstand is, you could substitute something else that people put a light on so it can give light to the house.
    * Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on __a high shelf__. \\ 

  * **Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and __sowed__ in his field. This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."** (Matthew 13:31-32) - To sow seeds means to toss them so that they scatter on the ground. If people are not familiar with sowing, you can substitute planting.

  * **__He said__, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it? It is like a mustard seed, which when it is sown it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground. Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade."** (Mark 4:30-32 ULB) 
    * "__He told them a story about how the Kingdom of God grows__. "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it?
