Many times the Bible uses metonymy. If you do not recognize it as a metonymy you will not understand the passage or worse yet, get the wrong understanding of the passage.

### Description

**Metonymy** is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A **metonym** is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.
>and __the blood__ of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (1 John 1:7 ULB)

The blood represents Christ's death. 
>He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "__This cup__ is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. (Luke 22:20 ULB)

The cup represents the wine that is in the cup.

#### Metonymy can be used

  * as a shorter way of referring to something
  * to make an abstract idea more meaningful by referring to it with the name of a concrete object associated with it.

#### Reason this is a translation issue

  * If a metonym  is used, people need to be able to understand what it represents.

### Examples from the Bible

>The Lord God will give him __the throne__  of his father, David.  (Luke 1:32 ULB)

A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign". This means that God would make him become the king that was to follow King David.
>Immediately his mouth was opened (Luke 1:64 ULB)

The mouth here represents the power to speak. This means that he was able to talk again.
>who warned you to flee from __the wrath__  that is coming?  (Luke 3:7 ULB)

The word "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people, and as a result, he would punish them.

### Translation Strategies

If people would easily understand the metonym, consider using it. Otherwise, here is an option.

  1. Use the metonym along with the name of the thing it represents.
