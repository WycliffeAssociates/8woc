Merism is a figure of speech in which a person refers to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it.

### Description

Merism is a figure of speech in which a person refers to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it.
> "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty." (Revelation 1:8, ULB)


> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. (Revelation 22:13, ULB)

"Alpha and Omega" is a merism that includes everything from the beginning to the end. It means eternal.
>I praise you, Father, Lord of __heaven and earth__,  (Matthew 11:25 ULB)

"Heaven and earth" is a merism that includes everything that exists.

#### Reason this is a translation issue
Some readers may think that the phrase only applies to the items mentioned. They may not realize that it refers to those two things and everything in between. 

### Examples from the Bible
>__From the rising of the sun to its setting__, Yahweh's name should be praised. (Psalm 113:3 ULB)

This underlined phrase is a merism because it speaks of the east and the west and everywhere in between. It means "everywhere."
>He will bless those who honor him, both __young and old__. (Psalm 115:13) 

The underlined phrase is merism because it speaks of old people and young people and everyone in between. It means "everyone."

### Translation Strategies
