### God is one being, and he exists as the Holy Trinity, that is, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit

#### The Bible teaches that there is only one God.

In the Old Testament:
>Yahweh, he is God; there is __no other God__! (I Kings 8:60 ULB)

And in the New Testament:
>Jesus said,... This is everlasting life: that they should know you, __the only true God__. (John 17:3 ULB) 

(See also: Deuteronomy 4:35, Ephesians 4:5-6, 1 Timothy 2:5, James 2:19)

#### The Old Testament begins to reveal God's three persons.

>__God__ created the heavens... __The Spirit of God__ was moving... "Let __us__ make man in __our__ image."  (Genesis 1:1-2 ULB)


>God has spoken to us by a __Son__... through whom he also made the universe. His __Son__ is the radiance of his glory, the very character of his essence... about the __Son__ he says,... "__In the beginning, Lord, you laid earth's foundation__; the heavens are the work of your hands." (Hebrews 1:2-3, and 8-10 ULB quoting Psalm 102:25 ULB)

#### The Church has always found it impossible to state what the New Testament says about God without affirming that he exists in three distinct persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

>Jesus said, "...Baptize them into the name of __the Father__, of __the Son__, and of __the Holy Spirit__." (Matthew 28:19 ULB)


>God sent his __Son__, born of a woman,... God sent the __Spirit__ of his Son into our hearts, who calls, "Abba, __Father__." (Galatians 4:4-6 ULB)

See also: John 14:16-17, 1 Peter 1:2

Each person of God is fully God and is called "God" in the Bible.
>Yet for us there is only one __God the Father__ (1 Corinthians 8:6 ULB)

>Thomas answered and said to him, "My Lord and __my God__." __Jesus__ said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed." (John 20:28-29 ULB)

>But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to __the Holy Spirit__ and to keep back part of the price of the land?... You have not lied to men, but to __God__." (Acts 5:3-4 ULB)

Each person is also distinct from the other two persons. All three persons can appear separately at the same time. In the verses below, God the Son is baptized while God the Spirit comes down and God the Father speaks from heaven.
>After he was baptized, __Jesus__ came up... from the water... He saw the __Spirit__ of God coming down..., and a __voice__ [the Father's] came out... saying, "This is my Beloved __Son__..." (Matthew 3:16-17 ULB)
