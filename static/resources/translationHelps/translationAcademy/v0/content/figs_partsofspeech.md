Parts of speech are categories of words. All languages have parts of speech, and all words in a language belong to a part of speech. All languages have some of these parts of speech, and some languages have others.  This is not an exhaustive list of parts of speech, but it covers the basics.

**VERBS** are words that express either an action (such as come, go, eat) or a state-of-being (such as is, are, was.) More detailed information can be found on [Verbs](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_verbs.md).

**NOUNS** are words that represent a person, place, thing, or idea. Common nouns are generic (man, city, country). Names are capitalized and refer to a specific entity (Peter, Jerusalem, Egypt). For more information see [How to Translate Names](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/translate_names.md).

**PRONOUNS** take the place of nouns and include such words as he, she, it, they and we. More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on [Pronouns](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_pronouns.md).

**CONJUNCTIONS** are words that join phrases or sentences. Examples include: and, or, but, for, yet, nor. Some conjunctions are used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also. More information about these can be found on [Connecting Words](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_connectingwords.md))

**PREPOSITIONS** are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, "The boat was __off the shore__." Here the phrase with the preposition "off" tells the location of the boat in relations to the shore. Another example is "The crowd __around Jesus__ grew in numbers." The phrase with the preposition "around" tells the location of the people in relation to Jesus. Some examples of prepositions are: to, from, in, out, on, off, with, without, above, below, before, after, behind, in front of, among, through, beyond, among.

**ARTICLES** are words that are used with nouns to show whether or not the speaker is referring to something that his listener should be able to identify. In English these words are: a, an, the. The words "a" and "an" mean the same thing. If a speaker says "__a__ dog" he does not expect his listener to know which dog he is talking about; this might be the first time he says anything about a dog. If a speaker says "__the__ dog," he is usually referring to a specific dog, and he expects his listener to know which dog he is talking about. English speakers also use "the" to show that they are talking about something in general. For example the can say "__The__ elephant is a large animal" and refer to elephants in general, not a specific elephant. More information about this can be found on [Generic Noun Phrases](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_genericnoun.md).

**ADJECTIVES** are words that describe nouns and express such things as quantity, size, color, and age. Some examples: many, big, blue, old, smart, tired. Sometimes people use adjectives to give some information about something, and sometimes people use them to distinguish one item from another. For example, in "my elderly father" the adjective "elderly" simply tells something about my father.  But in "my eldest sister" the word "eldest" distinguishes that sister from any other older sisters I might have. More information about this can be found on [Distinguishing versus Informing or Reminding](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_distinguish.md).

**ADVERBS** are words that describe verbs or adjectives and tell such things as how, when, where, why, to what extent. Many English adverbs end in 'ly.' Some examples of adverbs: slowly, later, far, intentionally, very.
