A simile is a comparison of two things that are not normally thought to be similar. One is said to be "like" the other. It focuses on a particular trait the two items have in common, and it includes the words "like," "as" or "than."

==== Description ====

A simile is a comparison of two things that are not normally thought to be similar. It focuses on a particular trait the two items have in common, and it includes the words "like," "as" or "than."
>When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were worried and confused, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. ([[en:bible:notes:mat:09:35|Matthew 9:36]] ULB)
Jesus compared the crowds of people to sheep without a shepherd. Sheep  grow frightened when they do not have a good shepherd to lead them in safe places. The crowds were like that because they did not have good religious leaders. 
>See, I send you out __as sheep in the midst of wolves__, so be as  wise __as  serpents__ and harmless __as  doves__. ([[en:bible:notes:mat:10:16|Matthew 10:16]] ULB)
Jesus compared his disciples to sheep and their enemies to wolves. Wolves attack sheep. Jesus' enemies would attack his disciples.
>For the word of God is living and active and sharper __than any two-edged sword__. ([[en:bible:notes:heb:05:12|Hebrews 4:12]] ULB)
God's word is compared to a two-edged sword. A two-edged sword is a weapon that can easily cut through a person's flesh. God's word is very effective in showing what is in a person's heart and thoughts.

=== Purposes of Simile ===

  * A simile can teach about something that is unknown by showing how it is similar to something that is known.
  * A simile can emphasize a particular trait, sometimes in a way that gets people's attention.
  * Similes help form a picture in the mind or help the reader experience what he is reading about more fully.

=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * People may not know how the two items are similar.
  * People may not be familiar with the item that something is compared to.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>Suffer hardship with me,  __as a good soldier of Christ Jesus__.  ([[en:bible:notes:2ti:01:03|2 Timothy 2:3]] ULB)
In this simile, Paul compares suffering with what soldiers endure, and he encourages Timothy to follow their example.
>for __ as the lightning appears when it flashes from one part of the sky to another part of the sky__, so will the Son of Man be in his day.  ([[en:bible:notes:luk:17:22|Luke 17:24]] ULB)
This verse does not tell how the Son of Man will be like the lightening. But from the context we can understand from the verses before it that just as lighting flashes suddenly and everyone can see it, the Son of Man will come suddenly and everyone will be able to see him. No one will have to be told about it.

==== Translation Strategies ====

If people would understand the correct meaning of a simile, consider using it. If they would not, here are some strategies you can use:
  - If people do not know how the two items are alike, tell how they are alike. However, do not do this if the meaning was not clear to the original audience.
  - If people are not familiar with the item that something is compared to, use an item from your own culture.  Be sure that it is one that could have been used in the cultures of the Bible. 
  - Simply describe the item without comparing it to another.
