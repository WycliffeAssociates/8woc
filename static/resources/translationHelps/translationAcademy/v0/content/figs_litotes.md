Litotes is a strong statement made by negative phrases to strengthen a positive meaning.  It is used to show that the opposite idea is not true.

### Description

Litotes is a strong statement made by negative phrases to strengthen a positive meaning.  It is used to show that the opposite idea is not true.

#### Reason this is a translation issue

People who speak some languages do not use litotes and would fail to understand that the statement is strengthened. They might think that it is weakened or even canceled.

### Examples from the Bible

>For you yourselves know, brothers, our coming to you was __not useless__, (1 Thessalonians 2:1 ULB)

By using litotes, Paul emphasized that his visit with them was very worthwhile. 
>All things were made through him. __Without him__ was __not one thing__ made that has been made. (John 1:3 ULB)

By using litotes John emphasized that the Son of God created absolutely everything.
>Now when it became day, there was __no small excitement__ among the soldiers, regarding what had happened to Peter.  (Acts 12:18 ULB)

By using litotes, Luke emphasized that there was a lot of excitement or anxiety among the soldiers about what happened to Peter. (Peter had been in prison, and even though there were soldiers guarding him, he escaped when an angel let him out. So they were very concerned.)

>And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,  
>are __not the least__ among the leaders of Judah,  
>for from you will come a ruler  
>who will shepherd my people Israel.  (Matthew 2:6 ULB)

By using litotes, the prophet emphasized that Bethlehem would be a very important city.
