==== translationQuestions ====

It is the duty of the translator, to the best of his ability, to make sure that each Bible passage he translates has the meaning that the writer of that Bible passage intended it to communicate. In order to do this, he will need to study translation helps prepared by Bible scholars, including the translationQuestions resource. 

The translationQuestions are about information as it appears in the story on in the ULB and can be used to self-check your translation. 

Using the translationQuestions during community checks will help the translator know if the Target Language translation is clear and accurate. If the community member's answer and the answer in the program are the same, then the translation might be clear and accurate.


==== Checking Translations with the translationQuestions ====

In order to use translationQuestions, follow these steps when doing a self-check:
  - Translate a passage, or chapter, of the Bible.
  - Look at the section called "Questions."
