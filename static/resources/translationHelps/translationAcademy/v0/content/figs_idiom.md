An idiom is a certain kind of figure of speech, the kind that usually cannot be correctly understood without being told its true meaning. Every language has them. Some English examples are:
  * You are pulling my leg (This means, "You are telling me a lie")
  * Do not push the envelope (This means, "Do not take a matter to its extreme") 
  * This house is under water (This means, "The debt owed for this house is greater than its actual value")
  * We are painting the town red (This means, "We are going around town tonight celebrating very intensely")

==== Description ====

An idiom is a phrase that has a special meaning to the people of the language or culture that uses it. Its meaning may be different from what a person would understand from the meanings of the individual words that form the phrase.
>he resolutely __set his face__ to go to Jerusalem. ([[en:bible:notes:luk:09:51|Luke 9:51]] ULB)
The words "set his face" is an idiom that means "decided." 

Sometimes people may be able to understand an idiom from another culture, but it might sound like a strange way to express the meaning.
> I am not worthy that you should __enter under my roof__. ([[en:bible:notes:luk:07:06|Luke 7:6]] ULB) 
The words "enter under my roof" is an idiom that means "enter my house."
> Let these words go deeply into your ears  ([[en:bible:notes:luk:09:43|Luke 9:44]] ULB)
This idiom means "Listen carefully and remember what I say."

**Purpose**: An idiom is created in a culture probably somewhat by accident when someone describes something in an unusual way. But, when that unusual way communicates the message powerfully and people understand it clearly, other people start to use it.

=== Reasons this is a translation issue ===

  * People can easily misunderstand idioms in the original languages of the Bible if they do not know the cultures that originally wrote the Bible.
  * People can easily misunderstand idioms that are in the source language Bibles if they do not know the cultures that made those translations.

==== Examples from the Bible ====

>"Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone." ([[en:bible:notes:1ch:11:01|1 Chronicles 11:1]] ULB)
This means, "We and you belong to the same race, the same family."
> The kings of the earth take their stand together ([[en:bible:notes:psa:002:001|Psalm 2:2]] ULB)
This means, "The kings on earth plan together." 
>the one who lifts up my head" ([[en:bible:notes:psa:003:003|Psalm 3:3]] ULB)
This means, "the one who helps me." 


==== Translation Strategies ====

If the idiom would be clearly understood in your language, consider using it. If not, here are some other options.
  - Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.
  - Use a different idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.

==== Examples of Translation Strategies Applied ====

1. Translate the meaning plainly without using an idiom.
  * **Then all Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look, we are your flesh and bone."** ([[en:bible:notes:1ch:11:01|1 Chronicles 11:1]] ULB)
    * "...Look, we all belong to the same nation."

  * **he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.** ([[en:bible:notes:luk:09:51| Luke 9:51]] ULB) 
    * "He started to travel to Jerusalem, determined to reach it."

  * **I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.** ([[en:bible:notes:luk:07:06|Luke 7:6]] ULB) 
    * "I am not worthy that you should enter my house."

2. Use an idiom that people use in your own language that has the same meaning.

  * **Let these words go deeply into your ears**  ([[en:bible:notes:luk:09:43|Luke 9:44]] ULB) 
    * "Be all ears when I say these words to you." 

  * **"My eyes grow dim from grief** ([[en:bible:notes:luk:09:05 |Psalm 6:7 ]]ULB)
    * "I am crying my eyes out"
