Grammar has two main parts: words and structure. Structure involves how we put words together to form phrase, clauses, and sentences.

**Parts of Speech** - All words in a language belong to a category called a  part of speech.  (See: [Parts of Speech](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_partsofspeech.md))

**Sentences** -  When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See: [Sentence Structure](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentences.md))

  * Sentences can be statements, questions, commands or exclamations. (See: [Exclamations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentencetypes.md))
  * Sentences can have more than one clause. (See: [Sentence Structure](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_sentences.md))
  * Some languages have both active and  passive sentences (See: [Active or Passive](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_activepassive.md))

**Possession** - This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with "of" as in "the love of God," or with "'s" as in "God's love," or with a possessive pronoun as in "his love." (See [Possession](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_possession.md))

**Quotations** -  A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.  

  * Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See: [Quotations and Quote Margins](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/writing_quotations.md)) 
  * Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes  (See: [Direct and Indirect Quotations](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotations.md)) 
  * Quotes can have quotes within them (See: [Quotes within Quotes](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotesinquotes.md))  
  * Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what. (See [Quote Markings](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_quotemarks.md))
