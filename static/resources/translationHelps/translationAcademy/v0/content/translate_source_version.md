==== Importance of Version Numbers ==== 

Especially in an open project like unfoldingWord, it is important to keep track of published versions. It is important because translations (and source texts) can change frequently. Being able to identify each version helps bring clarity about which iteration is being talked about. Version numbers are also important because all translations should be based off of the latest source text. If the source text changes, the translation should be updated to match the latest version. 

Before starting a translation project, please ensure that you have the latest version of the source text.

==== How Versioning Works ====

Version numbers are only given when a work is published, not when they are edited (in Door43 or translationStudio). Edit revision is kept in Door43, but this is different than a work being given a version number.

Prior to August 1, 2015, the versioning system used by unfoldingWord was very complex. Each major revision would increase the version number by 0.1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 1.1) while each minor revision would change it by 0.0.1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 1.0.1). When translations were created based off of a version number, it became widely complex to keep track of what translation was based off of which version. 

On August 1, 2015, a new versioning system was adopted. Each source text was given an integer (e.g. ver 1). Any edits made to the source text increased the integer by 1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 2). Any translations based off of that source text took the version number the translation was based off of and added .1 (e.g. a translation off of ver 2 would be published as ver 2.1). A translation off of that translation would add a .1 to the version number it was created from (e.g. a translation off of ver 2.1 would be published as 2.1.1). Any time a text was updated, the number associated with that text would increase by 1 (e.g. if ver 2.1.1 was updated, it would become ver 2.1.2; ver 2.1 would become ver 2.2; etc). For a complete explanation of unfoldingWord versioning please read https://unfoldingword.org/versioning .

//Note: For Open Bible Stories, all translations ver 3.x and before are the old system, ver 4 and above are the new system.//

==== Where to Find the Latest Version ====

https://unfoldingword.org always has the latest published version of each resource. 

//Note: translationStudio and the unfoldingWord app do not always have the latest versions since updating content does not happen automatically.//

==== How to Update a Previous Version of Open Bible Stories ====

=== Identify which Version of Open Bible Stories ===

Many translations have the version number listed. If the version number is not available, figuring out which version a translation was based off of is important. 

To figure out which version a particular translation was translated from, do the following:
  * Check story #45. If it ends with Philip looking at the chariot, then it is translated from version 1.x. If it ends with the Ethiopian Official smiling, go to the next step.
  * Check frame 06-02. If the phrase "to the land where Abraham's relatives lived" is not included, then it is translated from version 2.x. If it is included, it is translated from at least version 3.x. (Also check frame 09-06. If "in order to save him from being killed" is not included, it is translated from version 2.x. If it is included, it is translated from at least version 3.x.)
  * If you are still not sure, we have created a complete set of all the changes between Version 1.x (see https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html ) or Version 2.x (see https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html ) and the current version. Compare your translation to this list of changes to determine which version your translation was made from. Note: All text highlighted in green has been added, text highlighted in yellow has been changed, and text highlighted in red has been deleted. Only frames that have changed are included in these lists.
  * To make sure you have all the latest changes, look at the change log (see https://door43.org/en/obs/change-log/ ) and make sure these changes have been made in your language.

=== Update to the Latest Version of Open Bible Stories ===

Once you have identified which version of Open Bible Stories the translation in your language used, you will need to update the translation in your language to the latest version. To help simplify the update process, we have generated change logs of all of the changes that happened between version 1.x and the latest (see https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html ) and version 2.x and the latest (see https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html ). Simply go through these changes and update the text in your language according to those documents, and your translation of Open Bible Stories will be up to date.
