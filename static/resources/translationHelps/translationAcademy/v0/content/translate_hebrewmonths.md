### Description 

The Hebrew calendar used in the Bible has twelve months. Unlike the western calendar, its first month begins  in the spring of the northern hemisphere. Sometimes a month is called by its name (Abib, Ziv, Sivan), and sometimes it is called by its order in the Hebrew calendar year (first month, second month, third month). 

#### Reasons this is a translation issue 

* Readers may be surprised to read of months that they have never heard of, and they may wonder how those months correspond to the months they use.
* Readers may not realize that phrases such as "the first month" or "the second month" refer to the first or second month of the Hebrew calendar, not some other calendar.
* Readers may not know when the first month of the Hebrew calendar begins.
* The scripture may tell about something happening in a certain month, but readers will not be able to fully understand what is said about it if they do not know what season of the year that was.

#### List of Hebrew Months  
This is a list of the Hebrew months with information about them that may be helpful in the translation.

**Abib** - (This month is called **Nisan** after the Babylonian exile) - This is the first month of the Hebrew calendar. It marks when God brought the people of Israel out of Egypt. It is at the beginning of the spring season when the late rains come and people begin to harvest their crops. It is during the last part of March and the first part April on western calendars. The Passover celebration started on Abib 10, the Festival of Unleavened Bread was right after that, and the Festival of Harvest was a few weeks after that.

**Ziv** - This is the second month of the Hebrew calendar. This is during the harvest season. It is during the last part of April and the first part of May on western calendars.

**Sivan** - This is the third month of the Hebrew calendar. It is at the end of the harvest season and the beginning of the dry season. It is during the last part of May and the first part of June on western calendars. The Feast of Weeks is celebrated on Sivan 6.

**Ethanim** - This is the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. This is during the early rain season which would soften the land for sowing. It is during the last part of September and the first part of October on western calendars. The Feast of Ingathering and the Day of Atonement are celebrated in this month.

**Bul** - This is the eighth month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the rainy season when people plough their fields and sow seed. It is during the last part of October and the first part of November on western calendars.

#### Examples from the Bible 

<blockquote> You are going out of Egypt on this day, in __the month of Abib__. (Exodus 13:4 ULB) </blockquote>

> You must eat unleavened bread from twilight of the fourteenth day __in the first month of the year__, until twilight of the twenty-first day of the month. (Exodus 12:18 ULB)

#### Translation Strategies 
You may need to make some information about the months explicit. (See: [Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_explicit.md))

1. Tell the the number of the Hebrew month.
1. Use the months that people know. 
1. State clearly what season the month occurred in. 
1. Refer to the time in terms of the season rather than in terms of the month. (If possible, use a footnote to show the Hebrew month and day.)
