  "6": "The meat should be eaten on the day that you sacrifice it, but you may eat some of it on the next day. However, you must burn anything that remains until the third day.",
  "7": "For any of it to be eaten on the third day is very displeasing to me, and I will not accept that offering.",
  "8": "I will punish anyone who eats it after the second day, because he will have not respected what I say is holy. And that person must no longer be allowed to associate with my people.",

  "10": "And when you harvest your grapes, do not go back a second time to try to harvest some more, and do not pick up the grapes that have fallen on the ground.

  "11": "Do not steal anything.\n Do not tell lies.\n Do not deceive each other.",

  "17": "Do not hate anyone. Instead, honestly rebuke others who ought to be rebuked, in order that you also will not be guilty.",
  "18": "Do not try to get revenge against someone or be angry with someone for a long time. Instead, love other people like you love yourself. I, Yahweh your God, am commanding this.",

  "20": "If a man sleeps with a slave woman who has been promised to marry some other man, but if she has not been bought by that man and is still a slave, these two people must be punished. But because she was still a slave, she and the man who slept with her must not be executed.",
  "21": "However, that man must bring a ram to be slaughtered at the entrance of the sacred tent area, to be an offering in order that he no longer be guilty for his sin.",
  "22": "The priest will offer that ram to me. Then I will forgive that man for the sin which he committed.",
  "23": "When you enter the land that I have promised to give to you, and when you plant various kinds of fruit trees, you must not eat any of their fruit for three years.",
  "24": "In the fourth year you must set aside all of their fruit to belong to me; you must set it apart as holy, an offering to give me praise.",
  "25": "But in the fifth year, you will be permitted to eat their fruit. If you do that, your trees will produce much fruit. I, Yahweh your God, am promising that.",

  "27": "Do not shave the hair at the sides of your heads as pagan people do.",
  "28": "Do not cut your bodies when you are mourning for people who have died, and do not put tattoos on your bodies. I, Yahweh your God, am commanding this.",
  "29": "Do not disgrace your daughters by forcing them to become prostitutes. If you cause them to become prostitutes, soon the land will be filled with prostitutes and all other kinds of people's wicked behavior.",
  "30": "Honor my Sabbath days and revere my sacred tent, because I am Yahweh.",
  "31": "Do not seek advice from those who try to get the spirits of dead people give them advice. If you do that, I will no longer accept you. I am Yahweh your God.",
  "32": "Stand up when old people enter the room, and show that you respect them. You must also honor me, your God; that is who I am.",
  "33": "When foreigners live among you in your land, do not mistreat them.",
  "34": "You must treat them like you treat your fellow citizens. Love them as you love yourselves, and do not forget that once when you were foreigners in Egypt you were badly mistreated by the people of Egypt. I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you to do this.",
  "35": "When you are measuring things, to see how long they are or how much they weigh or how many there are,",
