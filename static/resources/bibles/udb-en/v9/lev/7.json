  "7": "The regulation is the same for the offerings to cause people to become acceptable to me again and the offerings for when they are guilty of not giving to me the things that I required from them. The meat of those offerings belongs to the priest who offers them.",
  "8": "When a priest slaughters an animal that he will completely burn on the altar, he may keep the animal's hide for himself.",
  "9": "Offerings of things made from flour that are baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or in a shallow pan belong to the priest who sacrifices those things for another person.",

  "15": "The meat of that offering must be eaten on the day that it is offered. None of it may be left to be eaten on the next day.",
  "16": "However, if your offering is the result of a vow that you made to Yahweh, or if it is an offering that you make voluntarily, you may eat some of the meat on the day it is offered, and anything that is left may be eaten on the next day.",
  "17": "But any meat that is left until the third day must be completely burned.",
  "18": "If any meat from the offering to promise friendship with Yahweh is eaten on the third day, Yahweh will not accept that offering. It will be useless to offer it because Yahweh will consider that it is worthless. Anyone who eats some of it will have to pay a penalty to Yahweh.",
  "19": "Meat that touches something that God considers to be impure must not be eaten. It must be completely burned. But as for other mea, anyone who has performed the rituals to become acceptable to God is allowed to eat it.",

  "21": "If anyone touches something that God considers to be impure and very displeasing to him, whether it is from a human or from an animal, and then he eats any of the meat of the offering to promise friendship with Yahweh, meat that belongs to Yahweh, he must no longer be allowed to associate with God's people.\"",
  "23": "\"Say this to the Israelite people: 'Do not eat any of the fat of cattle or sheep or goats.",
  "24": "The fat of an animal that is found dead or that has been killed by a wild animal may be used for other purposes, but you must not eat it.",
  "25": "Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which an offering has been made to Yahweh must no longer be allowed to associate with God's people.",
  "26": "And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.",
  "27": "If anyone eats blood, he must no longer be allowed to associate with God's people.\"",
  "28": "Yahweh also said to Moses,",
  "29": "\"Tell the Israelite people this: 'Anyone who brings an offering to promise friendship with Yahweh must bring part of it to be a sacrifice to Yahweh.",
  "30": "He himself must bring the offering that will be burned in the fire. He must bring the fat along with the breast of the animal and lift it high in front of Yahweh to present it as an offering to him.",
  "31": "The priest must burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and all his descendants.",
  "32": "You must give to the priest the right thigh of the animal that you presented to promise friendship with Yahweh.",
  "33": "The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of that sacrifice will receive the right thigh of the animal as his share.",
  "34": "From the offerings that the Israelite people give to promise friendship with Yahweh, he has declared that he has given to Aaron and his descendants the breast that is lifted high and the right thigh that is offered. Those portions will always be their regular share from the Israelite people.",
  "35": "Those are the portions of the offerings brought to Yahweh and burned in fire that are allotted to Aaron and his descendants on the day that you, Moses, will set apart to serve Yahweh as priests.",

  "38": "They are regulations that Yahweh gave to Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that he commanded the Israelite people to start bringing their offerings to him, in the wilderness around Sinai."
