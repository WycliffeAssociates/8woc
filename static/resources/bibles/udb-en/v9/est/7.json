  "1": "So the king and Haman arrived at the second feast with Queen Esther.",
  "2": "On the second day of the feast, while servants were serving the wine, the king said to Esther, \"What is your petition, Queen Esther? I will give you whatever you ask for. What do you want? I would give you up to half of my kingdom.\"",
  "3": "Esther replied, \"If you are pleased with me, my king, and if you are willing to do what I ask, save my life! And save the lives of my people.",
  "4": "For I and my people have been condemned to destruction by a decree. I and my people, we have been handed over to be annihilatedâ€”to be killed, destroyed. If we had only been sold into slavery, I would have kept quiet, for that kind of trouble would not have been worth bothering you about.\"",

  "8": "Then the king returned from the palace garden and went back to where they were serving the wine. Just then Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. The king said, \"Will he assault the queen in my own house, with me standing by?\" As soon as he said this, the servants put a cloth over Haman's face.",
  "9": "Then Harbona, one of the king's officials who served him said, \"Outside, near Haman's house, there is a gallows. It is twenty-three meters high. Haman made it for Mordecai, the one who spoke to protect the king!\" The king said, \"Hang him on it.\"",
