  "8": "So now I am also permitting you to write another letter with a new decree in it, so that you may save your people. You may put my name on the letters and use my ring to seal them. This is because no letter that has my name on it and that is sealed with my ring can ever be revoked.\"",
  "9": "Then the king's scribes were called at that time (in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty third day of the month).

It was written to the provincial governors, the governors and officials of the provinces that are from India all the way to Ethiopia, in total, 127 provinces. The letter was written to every province in the way that every language was written. It was also written to the Jews in their writing and language.",

  "16": "The Jews in Susa were now happy, instead of being afraid. They rejoiced instead of fearing, and other people honored them.",
  "17": "When the new decree arrived in every city and province, the Jews there celebrated and prepared feasts and were very joyful. And many people throughout the empire became Jews, because they had become very afraid of the Jews."
