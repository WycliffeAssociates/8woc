  "1": "It was about this time that King Herod Agrippa sent soldiers to arrest some of the leaders of the group of believers in Jerusalem. The soldiers put them in prison. He did that because he wanted to make the believers suffer.",
  "2": "He commanded a soldier to cut off the head of the apostle James, the older brother of the apostle John. So the soldier did that.",
  "3": "When Herod realized that he had pleased the leaders of the Jewish people, he commanded soldiers to arrest Peter, too. This happened during the festival when the Jewish people ate bread without yeast.",
  "4": "After they arrested Peter, they put him in prison. They commanded four groups of soldiers to guard Peter. Each group had four soldiers. Herod wanted to bring Peter out of prison and judge him in front of the Jewish people after the Passover Festival was finished. He then planned to execute Peter.",
  "5": "So for several days Peter stayed in prison. But the other believers in their group in Jerusalem were praying earnestly to God that he would help Peter.",
  "6": "The night before Herod planned to bring Peter out from prison to have him executed publicly, Peter was sleeping in the prison between two soldiers, with two chains binding him. Two other soldiers were guarding the prison doors.",
  "7": "Suddenly an angel from the Lord God stood beside Peter, and a bright light shone in his cell. The angel poked Peter in the side and woke him up and said, \"Get up quickly!\" While Peter was getting up, the chains fell off from his wrists. However, the soldiers were not aware of what was happening.",
  "8": "Then the angel said to him, \"Fasten your belt around you and put on your sandals!\" So Peter did that. Then the angel told him, \"Wrap your cloak around you and follow me!\"",
  "9": "So Peter put on his cloak and sandals and followed the angel out of the prison cell, but he had no idea that all this was really happening. He thought that he was dreaming.",
  "10": "Peter and the angel walked by the soldiers who were guarding the two doors, but the soldiers did not see them. Then they came to the iron gate that led into the city. The gate opened by itself, and Peter and the angel walked out of the prison. After they had walked some distance along one street, the angel suddenly disappeared.",
  "11": "Then Peter finally realized that what had happened to him was not a vision, but that it had really happened. So he thought, \"Now I really know that the Lord God sent an angel to help me. He rescued me from what Herod planned to do to me and also from all the things that the Jewish leaders expected would happen.\"",
  "12": "When Peter realized that God had rescued him, he went to Mary's house. She was the mother of John whose other name was Mark. Many believers had assembled there, and they were praying that God would help Peter somehow.",
  "13": "When Peter knocked at the outer entrance, a servant girl named Rhoda came to find out who was outside the door.",
  "14": "When Peter answered her, she recognized his voice, but she was so happy and excited that she did not open the door! Instead, she ran back into the house. She announced to the other believers that Peter was standing outside the door.",
  "15": "But one of them said to her, \"You are crazy!\" But she continued saying that it was really true. They kept saying, \"No, it cannot be Peter. It is probably his angel.\"",
  "16": "But Peter continued knocking on the door. So when someone finally opened the door, they saw that it was Peter, and they were completely amazed!",
  "17": "Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them exactly how the Lord God had led him out of the prison. He also said, \"Tell James, the leader of our group, and our other fellow believers what has happened.\" Then Peter left and went away somewhere else.",
  "18": "The next morning the soldiers who had been guarding Peter became terribly upset, because they did not know what had happened to him.",
  "19": "Then Herod heard about it. So he commanded soldiers to search for Peter, but they did not find him. Then he questioned the soldiers who had been guarding Peter, and commanded them to be led away to be executed. Afterwards, Herod went from the province of Judea down to the city of Caesarea, where he stayed for some time.",
  "20": "King Herod had been furiously angry with the people who lived in the cities of Tyre and Sidon. Then one day some men who represented them came together to the city of Caesarea in order to meet with Herod. They persuaded Blastus, who was one of Herod's important officials, to tell Herod that the people in their cities wanted to make peace with him. They wanted to be able to trade with the people that Herod ruled, because they needed to buy food from those regions.",
  "21": "On the day that Herod had planned to meet with them, he put on very expensive clothes that showed that he was king. Then he sat on his throne and formally addressed all the people who had gathered there.",
  "22": "Those who were listening to him shouted repeatedly, \"This man who is speaking is a god, not a man!\"",
  "23": "So, because Herod let the people praise him instead of praising God, immediately an angel from the Lord God caused Herod to become seriously ill. Many worms ate his intestines, and soon he died very painfully.",
  "24": "The believers continued telling God's message to people in many places, and the number of people who believed in Jesus was continually increasing.",
  "25": "When Barnabas and Saul finished delivering the money to help the Jewish believers in the province of Judea, they left Jerusalem and returned to the city of Antioch, in the province of Syria. They took John, whose other name was Mark, with them."
