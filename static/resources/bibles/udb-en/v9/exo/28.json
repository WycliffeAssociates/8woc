  "4": "The clothes that they are to make are a sacred pouch for Aaron to wear over his breast, a sacred apron, a robe, an embroidered tunic, a turban, and a sash. These are the clothes that your older brother Aaron and his sons must wear as they serve me by doing the work that priests do.",

  "11": "A gem cutter should engrave these names on the two stones. Then he should mount the stones in gold settings.",
  "12": "Then he should fasten the stones onto the shoulder straps of the sacred apron to represent the twelve tribes of Israel. In that way, Aaron will carry the names of the tribes on his shoulders in order that I, Yahweh, will never forget my people.",
  "13": "The settings for the stones must be made from gold.",
  "14": "Tell them to make two chains of gold that are braided like cords and to fasten the chains to the settings.\"",
  "15": "Tell the skilled workman to make a sacred pouch for Aaron to wear over his chest. He will use this to find out what I want the people to do.

  "30": "Put into the sacred pouch the two things--named Urim and Thummim--that the priest will use to determine my answers to the questions he asks.

  "34": "Between each of these decorations, they must fasten a tiny gold bell.",
  "35": "When Aaron enters the holy place in the sacred tent to do his work as a priest and when he leaves the sacred tent, the bells will ring as he walks. As a result, he will not die because of disobeying my instructions.",
  "36": "Tell them to make a tiny ornament of pure gold, and tell a skilled workman to engrave on it the words, 'Dedicated to Yahweh.'",
  "37": "They should fasten this ornament to the front of the turban by a blue cord.",
