  "3": "You will go to a land that will be very good for raising livestock and growing crops. But I will not go with you myself because if I did that, I might annihilate you while you are traveling because you are very stubborn people.\"",
  "4": "When the people heard these words, they were sad, and no one wore fancy clothing anymore.",
  "5": "Yahweh had said to Moses, \"Tell the Israelite people, 'You are very stubborn. If I were to go with you for even a moment, I would kill you. Now take off your fine clothing to show that you are sorry for your sin. Then I will decide how I will punish you.'\"",

  "7": "As the Israelite people were traveling, whenever they stopped and set up their tents, Moses set up the sacred tent outside the camp, far from the camp. He called it \"the tent of meeting.\" Everyone who wanted Yahweh to decide something for them would go out of the camp to the tent of meeting.",
  "8": "Whenever Moses went out to the tent of meeting, all the people would stand at their own tent entrances and watch him until he had walked into the tent of meeting.",
