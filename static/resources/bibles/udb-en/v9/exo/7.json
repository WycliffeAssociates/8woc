  "3": "But I will make the king stubborn. Because of this, even though I will do many kinds of miracles here in Egypt,",
  "4": "the king will not believe what you say. Then I will punish the people of Egypt very severely, and I will lead the tribes of my Israelite people out of Egypt.",
  "5": "Then, when I show my great power to the Egyptian people and bring the Israelite people out from among them, they will know that I am Yahweh, the all-powerful God.\"",
