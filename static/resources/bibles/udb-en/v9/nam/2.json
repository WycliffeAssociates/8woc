  "2": "Even though your soldiers have destroyed the descendants of Jacob, Yahweh will cause other nations to honor them again. Invaders from your country have ruined Israel as enemies would uproot a vineyard, but Israel will prosper again.\n\\b",
  "3": "The shields of the enemy soldiers who are coming to attack you will shine red as the sun shines on them,\n and they will wear bright red uniforms.\n The metal of their chariot wheels will flash when they line up before the battle,\n and their soldiers will lift up their cypress spear and wave them.",
  "4": "Their chariots dash through the streets of Nineveh\n and rush furiously through the plazas.\n Going as quickly as lightning,\n they look like flaming torches.\n\\b",

  "11": "After that happens, people will say,\ni \"What happened to that great city of Nineveh?\n It was like a den full of young lions,\n where the male and female lions lived and fed the young ones, where they were afraid of nothing",
  "12": "The soldiers in Nineveh were like lions that killed or strangled other animals \n and brought the meat to their dens.\"\n\\m",
  "13": "Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, says to the people of Nineveh,\ni \"I am your enemy;\n I will cause your chariots to burn in fire and go up in smoke.\n Your young men will be killed with swords.\n I will make all the valuable things you stole from other nations disappear.\n Your messengers will never again take messages to other nations, demanding that their armies surrender to them.\""
