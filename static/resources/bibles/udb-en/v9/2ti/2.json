  "3": "Endure as I do what we suffer for Christ Jesus, like a good soldier endures what he suffers.",

  "7": "Think about what I have just written, because, if you do, the Lord will enable you to understand everything that you need to understand.",
  "8": "As you suffer hardships, remember Jesus Christ, a descendant of King David. God raised him from the dead, as I also preach in the gospel message.",
  "9": "For this gospel I suffer to the point of being imprisoned as a criminal. But the word of God is not in prison.",
