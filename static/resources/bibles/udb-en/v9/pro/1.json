  "10": "My son, as sinners try to draw you into their sin with smooth talk and flattery, \n\\q2 do not listen to what they say and do not follow them.\n\\q1",
  "11": "They may say, \"Come with us! Join us!\n\\q2 We will hide in wait and we will take the life of one who passes by.\n\\q2 We will hide ourselves and we will rise up and attack a person who has done us no wrong—that will be our sport. \n\\q1",
  "12": "Like the grave has power to take even a healthy person and drag them to the place of the dead, we will take their life from them.\n\\q2 We will make them like those who fall into the place where there is no hope of escape.\n\\q1",
  "13": "We will find many valuable and expensive items,\n\\q2 and we will fill our houses with what we stole from them!\n\\q1",
  "14": "So, come, be part of our team!\n\\q2 We will split into equal shares, and give to each member of our team, from all the things we stole.\"\n\\q1",
  "15": "My son, do not walk that road with them!\n\\q2 Do not put your foot down on the same path on which they walk!\n\\q2",
  "16": "They run to the places where they do terrible things,\n\\q2 They hurry so they can commit murder.\n\\q1",

  "19": "These are the ways of all who gain their riches through theft and deceit; \n\\q2 the things they stole destroy the lives of the thieves who cling to them. \n\\q1",
  "20": "Wisdom is like a woman who cries out in the streets.\n\\q2 Wisdom calls out to people in the plazas.\n\\q1",
  "21": "At the intersection of busy streets she cries out \n\\q2 and at the entrance of city gates.\n\\q1",
  "22": "She cries, \"How long will you who have not been taught, will you love being enticed to do what will harm you?\n\\q2 How long will you who think you know more than the wise, have so much joy in the little you know?\n\\q2 How long will you fools refuse to learn? \n\\q1",
  "23": "If you pay attention to me when I correct you,\n\\q2 I will tell you all I am thinking. \n\\q2 I will help you understand what I am saying to you.\n\\q1",
  "24": "But when I called to you, you refused to listen.\n\\q2 I beckoned you and stretched out my hands to you,\n\\q but no one paid any attention. \n\\q1",

  "27": "When troubles strike you like a powerful storm,\n\\q2 and disasters hit you like a violent wind,\n\\q2 when you experience distress and you go through difficulties,\n\\q2 I will have contempt for you.\n\\q1",
  "28": "When people call to me to help them,\n\\q2 but I will not answer them.\n\\q2 They will be desperate for my help, and search everywhere for me,\n\\q2 but they will not find me.\n\\q1",
  "29": "They reject what I say and they hate what I know,\n\\q and they made a choice not to show respect to Yahweh.\n\\q1",
  "30": "They would not obey what I told them to do,\n\\q and they did not pay attention when I tried to correct them.\n\\q",
  "31": "So they will experience the consequences of their actions\n\\q2 when they carry out their evil plans. \n\\q1",
  "32": "Those who have not been taught wisdom are foolish. \n\\q2 Fools choose to make no decision about anything, but be sure of this: their failure to make a decision will destroy their lives. \n\\q1",
  "33": "But those who pay attention to me will live in peace and safety,\n\\q2 and they will rest and not be afraid of any disaster that may come.\""
