  "23": "When you study wisdom, think of it as buying truth, but never selling it; \n\\q2 and the same for wisdom, and with discipline, and also with understanding; \n\\q2 let it be as though you were buying them so you can keep them for the rest of your life. \n\\q1",

  "28": "The immoral woman is waiting for you, waiting like a robber waits for his victim; \n\\q2 and they cause many men to become liars and traitors to those who love them.\n\\q1",
  "29": "Who is it who had trouble? Who has sorrows? Who has conflicts and fights?\n\\q2 Who has quarreling? Who is wounded for no reason?\n\\q2 Whose eyes are always bloodshot because they drank too much or ate too much?\n\\q1",
