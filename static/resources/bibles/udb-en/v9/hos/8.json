  "2": "My people Israel cry out to me and say,\n\\q2 'Our God, we are loyal to you!'\n\\q1",
  "3": "But the people of Israel have thrown away what is good,\n\\q2 so their enemies will chase after them.\n\\q1",
  "4": "Israel has appointed kings for themselves,\n\\q2 but they did not consult with me about it.\n\\q1 They chose their own kings \n\\q2 without asking me to approve them.\n\\q1 They took their silver and gold and formed them into the idols they worshiped, \n\\q2 but the people will perish as a result.\"",
  "5": "The prophet says, \"Yes, Yahweh has rejected your idol, you people of Samariaâ€”an idol made in the form of a calf!\"\n\\q1 Yahweh says, \"Perhaps these people will never again be innocent of evildoing. I am very angry with them!\n\\q2",

  "13": "Let us think about the sacrifices that they give to me. \n\\q2 They sacrifice the meat and then they eat it;\n\\q1 but I, Yahweh, am not pleased with those sacrifices.\n\\q2 I will think about their sins and will punish the people for them.\n\\q1 I will make them go back to Egypt.\n\\q1",
  "14": "And why has this happened? \n\\q2 The people of Israel have forgotten me, the God who made them a nation. Instead of honoring me, they have built huge homes to live in.\n\\q1 And instead of worshiping Yahweh, the people of Judah have built walls around their cities for protection. \n\\q2 So this is what I, Yahweh, will do: \n\\q1 I will send a fire that will destroy all their palaces and all their fortified cities.\""
