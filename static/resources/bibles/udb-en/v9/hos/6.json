  "2": "After the second day he will restore our strength;\n\\q2 and on the third day he will raise us up,\n\\q2 so we will live close to him.\n\\q1",
  "3": "Try to know Yahweh;\n\\q2 do all you can to be faithful to him.\n\\q1 It is as certain as tomorrow's sunrise\n\\q2 that he will come to us; he will come to us like the rain,\n\\q1 like the rain comes in the spring on our fields.\"\n\\q1",

  "5": "I sent my prophets to you, \n\\q2 and it was as though I had cut you into pieces when they spoke the messages I gave them.  \n\\q1 You were devastated by what they said to you. \n\\q2 It was as though I had killed you with the words I spoke to you.\n\\q1 I spoke about how I would punish you.\n\\q2 I told you by the prophets that I was angry with you, and they told you this.\"\n\\q1 \"Yahweh, you will punish them by commanding that it happen;\n\\q2 your words are like lightning bolts.\"\n\\q1",

  "11": "And for you also, you people of Judah,\n\\q2 I have set for you a time when I will separate out your good people from your bad people. \n\\q1 Just as in the harvest when you take all the crops in, \n\\q2 and you keep the good and throw away the bad, \n\\q1 that is what is coming for you, people of Judah. \n\\b\n\\q1 That will be the day when I bring back the blessings and riches of my people once more.\""
