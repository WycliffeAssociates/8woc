  "2": "But they do not take a moment to think that I, Yahweh, see everything they do. \n\\q2 Everywhere they go, they commit evil,\n\\q1 and I see it all.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "3": "The wicked things they do bring delight to their king, \n\\q2 and the king's officials are happy when they tell lies.\n\\q1",
  "4": "They are all sexually immoral;\n\\q2 they burn with lust like a baker's oven that is burning hot;\n\\q1 once he lights the fire, he does not need to put any more wood on it, \n\\q1 until he is ready to bake the bread. \n\\q1",
  "5": "At the king's festivals, his officials do outrageous things because they are drunk with wine,\n\\q2 and the king joins in with them as they mock me.\n\\q1",
  "6": "But these same officials then set about making plans to murder the king. \n\\q2 They are quietly angry all night, \n\\q1 and they are openly angry in the morning.\n\\q1",
  "7": "All those officials become so angry at the king,\n\\q2 that they kill all their rulers.\n\\q1 In the end, all their kings were killed;\n\\q2 not one of them called on me, Yahweh, to help.\"\n\\q1",
  "8": "\"Israel joins with other people groups, \n\\q2 but all the people are like a flat cake that is only cooked on one side; they are weak.\n\\q1",

  "10": "Israel is so proud that everyone else sees it. \n\\q2 Even so, they will not return to meâ€”to Yahweh their God.\n\\q1 They will not try to persuade me to have mercy on them, no matter what happens to them.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "12": "But when they are on their way there,\n\\q2 I will spread my net over them,\n\\q2 I will bring them down as a hunter brings down birds from the air into a net. \n\\q1 I will punish them all together.\n\\q1",
  "13": "How terrible it will be \n\\q2 for my people, because they have abandoned me! \n\\q1 They will perish\n\\q2 because they have rebelled against me.\n\\q1 I wanted to rescue them,\n\\q2 but they kept telling lies against me.\n\\q1",
