  "2": "You want fields that belong to other people,\n\\q2 so you seize them;\n\\q2 you also take their houses.\n\\q1 You cheat people to get their homes,\n\\q2 taking away the property that belongs to their families.",
  "3": "Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:\n\\q1 \"I will cause you people of Israel to experience disasters,\n\\q2 and you will not be able to escape from them.\n\\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,\n\\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.\n\\q1",
