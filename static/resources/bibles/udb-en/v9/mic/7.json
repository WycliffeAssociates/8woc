  "4": "Even the best people are as worthless as briers;\n\\q2 the people who we thought to be the most honest are worse than thornbushes.\n\\q1 But Yahweh will soon judge them.\n\\q2 Now is the time that he will punish people,\n\\q2 when they will be very confused because of it.\n\\q1",

  "8": "You who are our enemies,\n\\q2 do not gloat about what has happened to us,\n\\q1 because even if we have experienced disasters,\n\\q2 those disasters will end, and we will be prosperous again.\n\\q1 Even if it is as though we are sitting in the darkness,\n\\q2 Yahweh will be our light.\n\\q1",
  "9": "We must be patient while Yahweh punishes us\n\\q2 because we have sinned against him.\n\\q1 But later, it will be as though he will go to court and defend us.\n\\q2 He will make sure that the judge makes a right decision about us.\n\\q1 It will be as though he will bring us out into the light,\n\\q2 and we will see him rescue us.\n\\q1",
  "10": "Our enemies will also see it, and they will be disgraced\n\\q2 because they ridiculed us, saying\n\\q1 \"Why is Yahweh, that God of yours, not helping you?\"\n\\q2 But with our own eyes we will see them be defeated;\n\\q2 we will see them trampled\n\\q2 like mud in the streets.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "12": "Your people will come back to you from many countries,\n\\q2 from Assyria, from near the Euphrates River in the east, and from Egypt in the south,\n\\q1 from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean Sea,\n\\q2 and from many mountains.\n\\q1",

  "19": "You will again act kindly toward us.\n\\q2 You will get rid of the scroll on which you have written the sins that we have committed,\n\\q2 as though you were trampling it under your feet\n\\q2 or throwing it into the deep ocean.\n\\q1",
  "20": "You will show that you faithfully do what you promised for us and faithfully love us,\n\\q2 just as you solemnly promised long ago to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob that you would do."
