  "8": "Yahweh will bless you by filling your barns with grain, and he will bless all the work that you do;\ni he will bless you in the land that he is giving to you.",
  "9": "If you obey all the commandments that Yahweh our God has given to you and if you live your lives by following his commandments, he will make you his own, his holy people, which is just as he promised.",
  "10": "Then all the people groups on the earth will realize that you belong to Yahweh, and they will be afraid of you.",
  "11": "And Yahweh will cause you to prosper very much. He will give you many children, many cattle, and abundant crops in the land that he solemnly promised to our ancestors that he would give to you.",
  "12": "At the time that rain is needed, Yahweh will send it from where he stores it in the sky, and he will bless all your work, with the result that you will be able to lend money to many other nations, but you will not need to borrow money from them.",

  "30": "Some of you men will be engaged to marry a young woman, but someone else will forcibly sleep with her.\ni You will build houses, but you will never live in them.\ni You will plant grapevines, but you will not eat the grapes; someone else will eat them.\ni",
  "31": "Your enemies will butcher your cattle while you watch them, and you will not get any of the meat to eat.\ni They will drag away your donkeys while you watch them do it, and they will not give them back to you.\ni They will take away your sheep; and there will not be anyone to help you rescue them.\ni",

  "38": "You will plant plenty of seeds in your fields, but you will reap only a small harvest, because locusts will eat the crops.\ni",
  "39": "You will plant grapevines and take care of them, but you will not pick any grapes to make wine, because worms will eat the vines.\ni",
  "40": "Olive trees will grow everywhere in your land, but you will not get any olive oil to rub on your skin because the olives will drop on the ground before they are ripe.\ni",
  "41": "You will have sons and daughters, but they will not stay with you, because they will be captured and taken away.\ni",
  "42": "Swarms of locusts will eat your crops and the leaves of all your trees.\ni",

  "46": "These disasters will solemnly warn you and your descendants forever what happens to groups who disobey Yahweh.",
  "47": "Because Yahweh blessed you abundantly in many ways, you should have served him very joyfully, but you did not do that.",
  "48": "Therefore, you will work for the enemies whom Yahweh will send to attack you. You will be hungry and thirsty; you will not have clothes to wear; and you will lack everything else that you need. And Yahweh will cause you to become slaves and work hard until he destroys you.",
  "49": "Yahweh will bring against you an army from very far away, soldiers who speak a language that you do not understand. They will swoop down on you quickly like an eagle.",
  "50": "They will be fierce looking. They will not act mercifully toward anyone, not even young children and old people.",

  "53": "When your enemies are surrounding your towns, you will be extremely hungry, with the result that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters that Yahweh your God has given to you.",
  "54": "54-55 When your enemies have surrounded your towns, even the most gentle and sensitive men among you will want food very desperately, with the result that they will kill their own children and eat their flesh, because they will not have anything else to eat. They will not even share any of it with their brothers or wives whom they love very much or with any of their other children who are still alive.",
  "55": "56-57 Even the most gentle and kind women among you, who are very rich with the result that they have never been forced to walk anywhere, will do the same thing. When your enemies have surrounded your towns, those women will be extremely hungry, with the result that after they give birth to a child, they will secretly kill the baby and eat its flesh and also eat the afterbirth. And they will not share any of it with their husbands whom they love very much or with any of their other children.",
  "58": "If you do not faithfully obey all of the laws that I am writing, and if you do not have the utmost respect for Yahweh our glorious God,",
  "59": "he will punish you by sending on you and on your descendants great afflictions and plagues which will last for many years.",
  "60": "He will bring on you the plagues that he sent on the people of Egypt, and you will never be healed.",
  "61": "He will also send on you many other sicknesses and diseases that I have not talked about in these laws, until you all will die.",
  "62": "You became as numerous as the stars in the sky, but only a few of you will remain alive, if you do not obey Yahweh your God.",
  "63": "Yahweh was very happy to do good things for you and to cause you to become very numerous, but now he will be happy to ruin you and get rid of you. Those of you who do not die from these plagues will be snatched away from the land that you will soon be entering to possess.",
  "64": "Yahweh will scatter you among many people groups, all over the earth, and in those places you will worship other gods that are made of wood or stone, gods which you and your ancestors have never known.",
  "65": "In those areas you will not have any peace. You will feel hopeless and be discouraged.",
  "66": "You will always be afraid that your enemies will kill you. You will be very fearful, all day and all night.",
  "67": "Because you will be very fearful and because you will very distressed because of the terrible things that you see, each morning you will say 'I wish it were evening already!' and each evening you will say 'I wish it were morning already!'",
  "68": "Yahweh will send some of you back to Egypt in ships, even though he promised that you would never be forced to go there again. There in Egypt you will try to sell yourselves to become slaves of your enemies in order to have food to eat, but no one will buy you.\""
