  "40": "You have given me strength for fighting battles\n\\q2 and caused those who were attacking me to fall down; I trampled on them.\n\\q1",
  "41": "You caused my enemies to turn and run away from me.\n\\q2 I destroyed those who hated me.\n\\q1",
  "42": "They looked for someone to rescue them, but no one did.\n\\q2 They cried out to you, Yahweh, for help, but you did not answer them.\n\\q1",
