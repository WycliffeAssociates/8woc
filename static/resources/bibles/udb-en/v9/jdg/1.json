  "26": "That man went to the area where the descendants of Heth lived, and he built a city. He named the city Luz, and that is still the name of that city.",
  "27": "There were Canaanites who lived in Beth Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo cities and in the surrounding villages. The men of the tribe of Manasseh did not force them to leave those towns, because the Canaanites were determined to stay there.",
