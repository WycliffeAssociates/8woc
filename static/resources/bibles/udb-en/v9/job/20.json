  "4": "Do you not know that from long ago,\n\\q2 ever since God first put people on the earth,\n\\q1",
  "5": "that wicked people like you do not continue to rejoice for a long time,\n\\q2 and that people who refuse to honor God are happy only for a moment?\n\\q1",
  "6": "Although their reputations reach up to the sky,\n\\q2 and their fame goes up as high as the clouds,\n\\q1",
  "7": "they will disappear forever, like their own excrement,\n\\q2 and those who knew them will ask, 'Where did they go?'\n\\q1",
  "8": "They will disappear as a dream does,\n\\q2 and they will exist no more.\n\\q1 They will vanish like dreams that people have during the night.\n\\q1",

  "10": "Their children will be forced to return the valuable things that they stole from poor people.\n\\q1",
  "11": "The bodies of the wicked were once young and strong,\n\\q2 but they will die and be buried in the ground.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "12": "Although doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths\n\\q2 that they wanted to continue tasting,\n\\q1",
  "13": "and although they did not want to stop doing those things,\n\\q1",
  "14": "those evil things will someday become like poison that they swallow,\n\\q2 or like the poison from snakes.\n\\q1",
  "15": "Wicked people pile up wealth for themselves, but they do not keep it forever,\n\\q2 just like people do not keep down the food that they vomit.\n\\q1 God takes their wealth from them.\n\\q1",
  "16": "Doing evil deeds is like swallowing snake poison;\n\\q2 doing evil will kill the wicked as the bite of a poisonous snake will kill people.\n\\q1",
  "17": "The wicked will not remain alive to see the abundant blessings from God,\n\\q2 which are like a stream that flows.\n\\q1",
  "18": "They will be forced to give back the things that they stole from the poor;\n\\q2 they will not be able to continue to enjoy those things.\n\\q1 They will not remain happy because of what they got from their business\n\\q1",
  "19": "because they oppressed poor people and refused to help them,\n\\q2 and they took other people's houses by cheating them.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "20": "They were always greedy and never satisfied.\n\\q2 So when they ate, they ate so much that they never saved anything that they enjoyed.\n\\q1",

  "25": "The arrows will go completely through their bodies and stick out of their backs;\n\\q2 the shiny points of the arrows will have blood dripping from them,\n\\q2 and those wicked people will be terrified.\n\\q1",
  "26": "Their valuable possessions will all be destroyed;\n\\q2 a fire started by God, not by humans, will burn them up\n\\q2 and will destroy the things that are left in their tents.\n\\q1",
