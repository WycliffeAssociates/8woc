  "4": "I will not say anything to you that is false;\n\\q2 I, who am standing in front of you, am someone who understands things very well.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "5": "Really, God is very powerful, and he does not despise anyone,\n\\q2 and he understands everything.\n\\q1",
  "6": "He does not allow wicked people to remain aliveâ€”contrary to what you have claimed,\n\\q2 and he always acts justly toward those who are suffering.\n\\q1",
  "7": "He always watches over those who are righteous;\n\\q2 he makes them prosper, as if they were kings, \n\\q2 and he causes others to honor them forever.\n\\q1",
  "8": "However, if people who commit crimes are caught,\n\\q2 or if they suffer in prison for having done wrong,\n\\q1",
  "9": "then God shows them what they have done;\n\\q2 he shows them the sins that they have committed,\n\\q2 and he shows them that they have been arrogant.\n\\q1",
  "10": "He causes them to listen to what he is warning them,\n\\q2 and he commands them to turn away from doing what is evil.\n\\q1",
  "11": "If they listen to him and serve him,\n\\q2 they will prosper and be happy for all the years that they continue to live.\n\\q1",

  "18": "Be careful that you are not deceived by desiring to acquire money\n\\q2 or that you are not ruined by accepting large bribes so that you yourself will treat others unfairly.\n\\q1",
  "19": "If that happens, it certainly will not help you to cry out when you are distressed;\n\\q2 none of your strength will help you in that case.\n\\q1",

  "31": "By providing plenty of rain for everyone,\n\\q2 he gives them abundant food.\n\\q1",
  "32": "It is as though he were holding the lightning in his hands,\n\\q2 and then he commands it to strike where he wants it to.\n\\q1",
