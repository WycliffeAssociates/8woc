  "15": "He asked them, \"Why did you allow the women to live?",
  "16": "They are the ones who did what Balaam suggested and urged our people to worship Baal instead of Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh caused a plague to strike his people while they were at Peor.",

  "24": "On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp.\"",
  "26": "\"Tell Eleazar and the leaders of the family groups that they must write down a list of all the goods, the women, and the animals that were captured in the battle.",
