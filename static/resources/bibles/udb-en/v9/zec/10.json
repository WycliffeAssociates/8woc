  "1": "Ask Yahweh to cause rain to fall in the springtime,\nbecause he is the one who makes the clouds from which the rain falls in storms.\nHe causes showers to fall on us,\nand he causes crops to grow well in the fields.",
  "2": "What people think that the idols in their houses say is only nonsense,\n and people who say that they can interpret dreams tell only lies.\nWhen they tell people things to comfort them, what they say is useless,\nso the people who consult them are like lost sheep;\nthey are in danger because they have no one to protect them \nlike sheep with no shepherd.",
  "3": "Yahweh says, \"I am angry with the leaders of my people,\nand I will punish them.\nI, Yahweh, the Commander of the angel armies, will take care of my people, the people of Judah,\nlike a shepherd takes care of his flock,\nand I will cause them to be like war horses in battle.",

  "8": "I will signal for my people to return from far away,\n and I will gather them together in their own country.\n I will rescue them,\nand they will become very numerous as they were previously.",
  "9": "I have caused them to be scattered among many people groups,\n but in those distant countries they will think about me again.\nThey and their children will remain alive and return to Judah.",

  "12": "I will enable my people to be strong,\nand they will honor me and obey me.\nThat will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.\""
