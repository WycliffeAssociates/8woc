  "3": "God's Son is the light of God's powerful brilliance. He shows exactly what God is truly like. All things that existâ€”he keeps them existing by giving powerful commands. After he had acted so that all sin should be forgiven, he rose into heaven and sat down at the highest place of honor, at the right side of God the Father, where he rules with him.",

  "5": "In the scriptures no one ever reported that God said to any angel what he said to his Son:\n\\q \"You are my Son!\n\\q Today I have declared to all that I am your Father!\"\n And he said in another scripture passage,\n\\q \"I will be his Father,\n\\q and he will be my Son.\"",

  "10": "We also know that his Son is superior to angels because in the scriptures it is written about God's Son,\n\\q \"Lord, it was you who created the earth in the beginning.\n\\q You also made the rest of the universe, the stars and everything in the sky.\n\\q",
  "11": "Those things will no longer exist, but you will keep on living forever.\n\\q They will wear out as clothing wears out.\n\\q",
  "12": "You will roll them up as if they were old clothes.\n\\q Then you will change all that is in the universe for something new, \n\\q like someone putting on new clothes.\n\\q But you stay the same, and you live forever!\"",
  "13": "God has never said to any angel what he said to his Son:\n\\q \"Sit in the most important place next to me and rule with me \n\\q while I defeat all of your enemies for you to rule over them!\"",
  "14": "The angels are only spirits whom God has sent out to serve and care for believers whom God will soon save completely, as he has promised to do for them."
