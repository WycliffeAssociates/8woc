  "2": "Because our ancestors trusted in God, he approved of them.",
  "3": "Because we trust in God, we understand that God formed the universe by commanding that it exist. So the things we see were not made from things that already existed.",
  "4": "Because Adam's son Abel trusted God, he sacrificed something better to God than what his older brother Cain offered to God. So God spoke well about what Abel sacrificed, and God declared that Abel was righteous. And although Abel is dead, we still learn from him about trusting God.",
  "5": "Because Enoch believed God, God took him up to heaven. Enoch did not die, but no one could find him. Before God took him away, he testified that Enoch pleased him well.",

  "13": "While they still trusted in God, all these people died. Even though they had not yet received the things that God had promised to give them, it was as though they had seen those things in the distance, and they were glad.
