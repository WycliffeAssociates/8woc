  "10": "Men who came from far the away lands of Persia, Lud, and Put, were soldiers in your army.\n\\q1 They hung their shields and helmets on the walls of your city;\n\\q2 this made many people to admire your city.\n\\q1",
  "11": "Men from the cities of Arvad and Helech were watchmen on your city walls;\n\\q2 men from the city of Gammad were in your towers.\n\\q1 They also hung their shields on your walls;\n\\q2 they also made your city very beautiful.",
  "12": "Because of the many things that you had to trade, men from Tarshish sent merchants who brought silver, iron, tin, and lead to trade for things that you had.",

  "23": "Men came from Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur and Kilmad in Mesopotamia with their goods.",
  "24": "They brought beautiful things to trade with you: blue cloth, embroidered cloth, and rugs of many colors that were rolled up and tied with ropes.\n\\q1",
  "25": "Cargo ships from Tarshish carried all those things that you sold;\n\\q2 the warehouses on your island were full of all those things and brought you great honor.\n\\q1",
  "26": "The men who row your ships took the ships full of cargo out onto the large seas.\n\\q2 But now the strong east wind has wrecked those ships.\n\\q1",
  "27": "Everything in the ships has been lost—\n\\q2 all the valuable cargo and many of the sailors and ship pilots,\n\\q1 the ship workers and merchants and soldiers.\n\\q1 On the day that the ships were wrecked,\n\\q2 all their crews sank to the bottom of the sea.\n\\q1",
  "28": "The people in cities along the coast trembled\n\\q2 when they heard your ship pilots cry out.\n\\q1",
  "29": "All the men who pulled the oars will leave the ships;\n\\q2 the sailors and pilots will come to the shore and stand on the beach.\n\\q1",

  "32": "While they wail and mourn because of what has happened to you\n\\q2 they sing this sad funeral song:\n\\q1 'There was certainly never a city like Tyre,\n\\q2 which now is silent,\n\\q2 covered by the waves of the sea.'\n\\q1",
  "33": "The goods that your merchants traded\n\\q2 were things that pleased the people of many countries.\n\\q1 Kings in very distant places became rich\n\\q2 from the money they made by buying and selling with you.\n\\q1",
  "34": "But now your city is like a ship is wrecked in the sea,\n\\q2 and everything that was in it is broken, at the bottom of the sea.\n\\q1 All of your cargo and your sailors have sunk to the bottom of the sea.\n\\q1",
  "35": "All the people who live along the seacoast are appalled\n\\q2 because of what has happened to you.\n\\q1 Their kings are very horrified;\n\\q2 they shake with fear as they watch.\n\\q1",
  "36": "The merchants of the other nations shake their heads\n\\q2 because it is difficult for them to believe what has happened;\n\\q1 now your city has disappeared,\n\\q2 and it will not exist anymore.\""
