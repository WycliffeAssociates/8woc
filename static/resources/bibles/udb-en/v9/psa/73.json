  "1": "God truly is good to us Israelite people,\n\\q2 to those who, with all their inner being, want to do all that he desires.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "2": "As for me, I almost stopped trusting in God;\n\\q1 I was almost guilty of committing a great sin against him\n\\q1",
  "3": "because I saw those who proudly said that they did not need God, and I wanted to be like them.\n\\q2 I saw that they became wealthy even though they were wicked.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "12": "That is what wicked people are like;\n\\q2 they never worry about anything, and they are always becoming richer.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "13": "So, God, I think it is useless that I have always done what you want me to\n\\q2 and that I have not committed sins.\n\\q1",
  "14": "During each day I have problems,\n\\q2 and every morning you punish me.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "16": "When I tried to think completely about these things,\n\\q2 it was too hard for me to understand them.\n\\q1",
  "17": "But when I went to your temple, you spoke to me,\n\\q2 and I understood what will happen to the wicked people after they die.\n\\b\n\\q1",
