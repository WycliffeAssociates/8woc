  "1": "If people are building a house without Yahweh helping them,\n\\q2 they are building it in vain.\n\\q1 Similarly, if Yahweh does not protect a city,\n\\q2 it is useless for guards to stay awake at night.\n\\q1",
  "2": "It is also useless to arise very early and go to sleep late at night\n\\q2 so that you can work hard all day to earn money to buy food\n\\q1 because Yahweh gives food to those whom he loves even while they sleep.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "3": "Children are a gift that comes to parents from Yahweh;\n\\q2 they are a reward from him.\n\\q1",
  "4": "If a man has sons while he is still young,\n\\q1 when they grow up, they will be able to help him defend his family\n\\q2 as a soldier can defend himself if he has a bow and arrows in his hand.\n\\q1",
  "5": "How fortunate is a man who has many sons;\n\\q2 he is like a soldier who has many arrows in his quiver.\n\\q1 If a man with his many grown sons is taken by his enemies to the place where they decide matters, his enemies will never be able to defeat that man\n\\q2 because his sons will help to defend him.",
  "127": "\\d A psalm written by Solomon for people going up to the temple to worship.\n\\b\n\\q1"
