  "3": "I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who do evil things to you. I will bless all the clans on earth through you.\"",
  "4": "So Abram left Haran, as Yahweh told him to do. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left there along with his family and Lot's family.",
  "5": "Abram took his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot; he also took with himself all the possessions and slaves that they had accumulated in Haran. They left from there and went to the land of Canaan.",

  "7": "Then Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him, \"I will give this land to your descendants.\" Then Abram built an altar to offer a sacrifice to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.",
  "8": "From Shechem, Abram and his family traveled to the hills that were east of Bethel. Bethel was to the west of where they set up their tent, and Ai was to the east. There he built another altar and offered a sacrifice and worshiped Yahweh there.",
  "9": "Then they left there and continued traveling south to the Negev desert.",

  "13": "So I ask you to tell them that you are my sister, so that I will be safe and so they will spare my life because of you.\"",
  "14": "And that was what happened. As soon as they arrived in Egypt, the people in Egypt saw that his wife was indeed very beautiful.",
  "15": "When the king's officials saw her, they told the king how beautiful she was. Then the king took her into his palace.",

  "17": "But because the king had taken Sarai, Abram's wife, Yahweh caused the king and the others in his household to be inflicted with terrible diseases.",
  "18": "So the king summoned Abram and said to him, \"You have done a terrible thing to me! Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?",
  "19": "Why did you say that she is your sister, so that I took her to be my wife? You should not have done that! So now take your wife, leave here and go!\"",
  "20": "Then the king ordered his officials to take Abram and his wife and all his possessions out of Egypt."
