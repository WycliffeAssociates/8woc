  "2": "Think about your ancestor Abraham and his wife Sarah, of whom all of you are descendants.\n\\q2 When I first spoke to Abraham,\n\\q1 he had no children.\n\\q2 But after I blessed him, he had a huge number of descendants.\n\\q1",
  "3": "Some day I, Yahweh, will encourage Abraham's descendants again,\n\\q2 and I will comfort all the people who live in the ruins of Jerusalem.\n\\q1 The deserts in that area will become like Eden;\n\\q2 it will be like the garden of Yahweh.\n\\q1 All the people there will be joyful and happy;\n\\q2 they will thank me and sing.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "4": "My people of Judah, listen carefully to me,\n\\q2 because I command you to proclaim my laws;\n\\q1 the right things that I will do will be like a light for the people of all the nations.",
  "5": "I will soon rescue you and them;\n\\q2 by my power I will rule over the people of the earth and bless them.\n\\q1 The people who live in the most distant lands on earth will wait for me to help them.\n\\q1",
  "6": "Look up at the sky,\n\\q2 and look at the earth;\n\\q2 see what they are like now,\n\\q1 because some day the sky will disappear like smoke,\n\\q2 and the earth will wear out like old clothes wear out,\n\\q2 and people on the earth will die like flies.\n\\q1 But I will rescue you, and you will remain free forever,\n\\q2 and I will rule you righteously forever.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "7": "You people who know what things are right to do,\n\\q2 and who know in your inner beings what is written in my laws,\n\\q1 listen to me!\n\\q2 Do not be afraid of people who taunt you;\n\\q2 do not be disturbed when people revile you,\n\\q1",
  "8": "because some day they will be destroyed\n\\q2 like clothing that moths have eaten,\n\\q1 like wool garments that have been eaten by worms.\n\\q2 I will save them, and they will be saved forever.\"\n\\q1",
  "9": "Yahweh, wake up and do something for us!\n\\q2 Show us how strong you are!\n\\q1 Do mighty things\n\\q2 like you did long ago,\n\\q2 when you stabbed Rahab, the sea monster, and cut it into pieces.\n\\q1",
  "10": "Surely you are the one who dried up the sea,\n\\q1 and made a path through that deep water\n\\q2 in order that your people could cross it!\n\\q1",
  "11": "And those whom Yahweh will rescue from being exiled in Babylonia\n\\q2 will similarly return to Jerusalem singing.\n\\q2 Their being joyful forever will be like a crown on their heads.\n\\q1 They will not be sad or mourn anymore;\n\\q2 they will be completely joyful and happy.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "14": "Soon you people who have been caused to be slaves in Babylonia will be freed!\n\\q1 You will not remain in prison, and you will not die of hunger,\n\\q1",

  "18": "Now you do not have any children who are alive \n\\q2 and who are able to take your hand and guide you. You cannot help yourself.\n\\q1",

  "22": "Yahweh, your Lord and your God,\n\\q2 the one who argues your case to defend you, says this:\n\\q1 \"It is as though I had taken that cup of bitter liquid from your hands;\n\\q2 I will not be angry with you and cause you to drink it any longer, to suffer anymore.\n\\q1",
  "23": "Instead, I will cause those who have tormented you to suffer;\n\\q2 I will severely punish those who said to you,\n\\q2 'Lie down in order that we may walk on you;\n\\q1 lie down on your stomachs\n\\q2 in order that your backs will be like streets that we can walk on.'\""
