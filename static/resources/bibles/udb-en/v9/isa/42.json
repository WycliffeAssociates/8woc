  "2": "He will not show his power by shouting \n\\q2 or by talking very loudly.\n\\q1",
  "3": "He will not get rid of anyone who is weak like a smashed reed,\n\\q2 and he will not end the life of anyone who is helpless, like an oil lamp about to stop burning.\n\\q1 He will faithfully make sure that judges decide cases justly.\n\\q2",
  "4": "He will not become exhausted or discouraged all during the time that he is causing things to be done justly throughout the earth.\n\\q1 Even people living on the islands in the oceans will confidently wait for him to teach them his laws.\"\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "5": "Yahweh our God created the sky\n\\q2 and spread it out.\n\\q1 He also created the earth and everything on it.\n\\q2 He gives breath to all the people on the earth and causes them to live.\n\\q1 And he is the one who says to his special servant,\n\\q1",

  "7": "For you will enable blind people to see,\n\\q2 you will free those who are in prison \n\\q2 and release those who are in dark dungeons.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "8": "I am Yahweh; that is my name.\n\\q2 I will not allow anyone else to receive the honor that only I deserve.\n\\q2 And I will not allow others to praise idols, for they should praise only me.\n\\q1",
  "9": "Everything that I have prophesied has happened,\n\\q2 and now I will tell about other things that will happen.\n\\q1 I will tell you things that will happen before they happen.\"\n\\q1",

  "25": "Therefore he was extremely angry with us,\n\\q2 and he caused our soldiers to be destroyed in battles.\n\\q1 It was as though he had lit a fire around us,\n\\q2 but we did not understand what he was trying to tell us.\n\\q1 His anger with us was like a fire that would burn us up,\n\\q2 but we did not pay attention."
