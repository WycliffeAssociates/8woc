  "3": "Our enemies run away when they hear your voice.\n\\q2 When you stand up and show that you are powerful, the people of all nations flee.\n\\q1",
  "4": "And after our enemies have been defeated,\n\\q1 we, your people, will take away all our enemies' possessions,\n\\q2 like caterpillars and locusts strip off all the leaves of plants.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "5": "Yahweh is greater than anyone else, and he lives in heaven,\n\\q2 and he will rule justly and righteously in Jerusalem.\n\\q1",
  "6": "When that happens, he will enable you to live securely;\n\\q2 he will fully protect your possessions,\n\\q2 he will enable you to be wise and to know all that you need to know;\n\\q1 and revering Yahweh will be like a valuable treasure that he will give to you.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "9": "The land of Judah is dry and barren.\n\\q2 The cedar trees in Lebanon are drying up and decaying.\n\\q1 The Plain of Sharon along the coast is now a desert plain.\n\\q2 There are no more leaves on the trees in the areas of Bashan and Carmel.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "10": "Yahweh says, \"Now I will arise and show that I deserve for everyone to honor me.\n\\q1",
  "11": "You people of Assyria make plans that are as useless as chaff and straw.\n\\q2 Your breath will become a fire that will burn you up.\n\\q1",
  "12": "Your people will be burned until only ashes remain, \n\\q2 like thornbushes are cut down and burned up.\n\\q1",
