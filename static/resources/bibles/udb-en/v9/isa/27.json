  "2": "At that time, Yahweh will say,\n\\q1 \"You Israelite people, who are like a fruitful vineyard, must sing!\n\\q2",
  "3": "I will protect you\n\\q2 like a farmer waters his crops carefully in order that they will grow well.\n\\q1 I will guard you day and night, in order that no one harms you.\n\\q1",
  "4": "I am no longer angry with my people;\n\\q1 if any of your enemies try to injure you like briers and thorns injure people,\n\\q2 I will attack them in battle;\n\\q2 I will get rid of them completely,\n\\q1",

  "12": "However, there will be a time when Yahweh will gather them together again; he will separate them from the people who have conquered them, like people separate wheat from chaff. He will bring them back to Israel, one by one, from the land between the Euphrates River in the northeast and the brook at the border of Egypt in the southwest.",
  "13": "At that time, a trumpet will be blown very loudly. And those who were exiled to Assyria and Egypt and who almost died there will return to Jerusalem, to worship Yahweh on Zion, his holy hill."
