  "6": "Foolish people say things that are foolish,\n\\q2 and they plan to do evil things.\n\\q1 Their behavior is disgraceful,\n\\q2 and they say things about Yahweh that are false.\n\\q1 They do not give food to those who are hungry,\n\\q2 and they do not give water to those who are thirsty.\n\\q1",
  "7": "Scoundrels do things that are evil and that deceive people;\n\\q2 they plan to do evil things;\n\\q1 by telling lies in court they cause poor people to have trouble,\n\\q2 even when what the poor people are requesting is fair.\n\\q1",
