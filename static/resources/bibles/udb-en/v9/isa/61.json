  "8": "\"I, Yahweh, am very pleased with those who decide matters fairly;\n\\q2 I hate those who illegally take things from other people.\n\\q1 I will surely repay my people\n\\q2 for all that they have suffered in the past.\n\\q1 And I will make an everlasting agreement with them.\n\\q1",

  "10": "I greatly rejoice because of what Yahweh has done!\n\\q2 I am happy in all my inner being,\n\\q1 because he has saved me and declared that I am righteous;\n\\q2 those blessings are like a robe that he has put on me.\n\\q1 I am as happy as a bridegroom in his wedding clothes,\n\\q2 or a bride wearing jewels.\n\\q1",
  "11": "Just as seeds sown in a garden sprout from the soil and grow,\n\\q2 Yahweh our God will cause people of all nations to act righteously,\n\\q1 with the result that they will praise him for doing that."
