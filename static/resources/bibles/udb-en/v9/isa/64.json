  "3": "You did awesome things that we were not expecting you to do;\n\\q2 the mountains shook when you came down onto Mount Sinai.\n\\q1",
  "4": "Since long ago no one has ever seen or heard about a God like you;\n\\q2 you help those who depend on you.\n\\q1",
  "5": "You help those who joyfully do what is right,\n\\q2 those who conduct their lives as you want them to.\n\\q1 But we did not do that; we continued to sin,\n\\q2 and so you became angry with us.\n\\q1 We have been sinning for a long time.\n\\q2 It is only if we continually do what you want us to do that you will save us.\n\\q1",
