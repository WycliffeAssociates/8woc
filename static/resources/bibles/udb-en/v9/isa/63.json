  "2": "I ask him, \"What are those red spots on your clothes?\n\\q2 It appears that you have been treading on grapes to make wine.\"\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "3": "He replies, \"I have been treading on my enemies, not on grapes.\n\\q2 I did it myself; no one helped me.\n\\q1 I punished them because I was very angry with them,\n\\q2 and my clothes became stained with their blood.\n\\q1",
  "4": "I did that because it was time for me to get revenge;\n\\q2 it was time to rescue my people from those who had oppressed them.\n\\q1",
  "5": "I searched for someone who would enable me to help my people,\n\\q2 but I was amazed that there was no one to help me.\n\\q1 So I defeated their enemies with my own power;\n\\q2 I was able to do that because I was very angry.\n\\q1",
  "6": "Because I was extremely angry, I punished the nations;\n\\q2 I caused them to stagger like drunk men,\n\\q1 and I caused their blood to pour out on the ground.\"\n\\q1",

  "8": "Yahweh said, \"These are my people;\n\\q2 they will not deceive me\";\n\\q2 so he rescued us.\n\\q1",
  "9": "When we had many troubles,\n\\q2 he was sad also.\n\\q1 He sent his angel from before his presence to rescue us.\n\\q2 Because he loved us and was merciful to us,\n\\q2 he saved us;\n\\q2 it was as though he had picked our ancestors up and carried them all those years during which they were oppressed in Egypt.\n\\q1",
  "10": "But we rebelled against him,\n\\q2 and we caused his Holy Spirit to be sad.\n\\q1 So he became like an enemy\n\\q2 who fought against us.\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "15": "\"Yahweh, look down from heaven;\n\\q2 look down on us from your holy and glorious home.\n\\q1 You were previously very concerned about us, and you acted powerfully to help us.\n\\q2 But it seems that you do not act mercifully and zealously for us anymore.\n\\q1",
  "16": "You are our father, even if\n\\q2 Abraham does not know what is happening to us,\n\\q2 and Jacob is not concerned about us, either,\n\\q1 but Yahweh, you are our father;\n\\q2 you rescued us long ago.\n\\q1",
  "17": "Yahweh, why did you cause us to wander away from your road?\n\\q2 Why did you cause us to be stubborn in our inner beings,\n\\q2 with the result that we no longer honor you?\n\\q1 Help us like you did previously,\n\\q2 because we are the people who serve you and belong to you.\n\\q1",
  "18": "We, your holy people, possessed your sacred temple for only a short time,\n\\q2 and now our enemies have destroyed it.\n\\q1",
  "19": "Now it seems as though we never were ruled by you,\n\\q2 as though we never belonged to you.\""
