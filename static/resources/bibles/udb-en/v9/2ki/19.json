  "4": "Perhaps Yahweh our God has heard everything that the official from Assyria said. Perhaps he knows that his master, the king of Assyria, sent him to insult the all-powerful God and that Yahweh will punish him for what he said. And Hezekiah requests that you pray for the few of us who are still alive here in Jerusalem.\"",
  "5": "When the messengers from Hezekiah came to Isaiah, and",
  "6": "Isaiah instructed them to go back to their master and tell him what Yahweh says: \"Those messengers from the king of Assyria have said evil things about me. But you should not be disturbed because of what they said.",

  "8": "The official from Assyria found out that the King of Assyria and his army had left the city of Lachish, and that they were attacking Libnah, which was a nearby city. So the official went there to report to him what had happened in Jerusalem.",

  "12": "Did the gods of the nations that were about to be destroyed by the armies of the previous kings of Assyria rescue them? Did those gods rescue the people in the region of Gozan or in the cities of Haran and Rezeph in northern Aram? Did they rescue the people of Eden who had been deported to the city of Tel Assar? None of the gods of those cities was able to rescue them.",

  "22": "Who do you think that you were despising and ridiculing?\n\\q2 Who do you think you were shouting at?\n\\q2 Who do you think you were looking at very proudly?\n\\q It was I, the holy God whom the Israelites worship.\n\\q",
  "23": "The messengers whom you sent \n\\q2 made fun of me.\n\\q You said, 'With my many chariots \n\\q2 I have gone to the highest mountains,\n\\q2 to the highest mountains in Lebanon.\n\\q We have cut down its tallest cedar trees\n\\q2 and its best cedar trees.\n\\q We have been to the most distant peaks\n\\q2 and to its densest forests.\n\\q",
  "24": "We have dug wells in other countries \n\\q2 and drunk water from them.\n\\q And by marching through the streams of Egypt,\n\\q2 we dried them all up!'\n\\b\n\\q",
  "25": "But I reply, 'Have you never heard that long ago \n\\q2 I planned that those things would happen?\n\\q I planned it long ago,\n\\q2 and now I have been causing it to occur.\n\\q I planned that your army \n\\q2 would have the power to capture many cities \n\\q3 that were surrounded by high walls,\n\\q2 and cause them to become piles of rubble.\n\\q",
  "26": "The people who lived in those cities have no power,\n\\q2 and as a result they became dismayed and discouraged.\n\\q They are as frail as plants and grass in the fields,\n\\q2 as frail as grass that grows on the roofs of houses\n\\q3 and is scorched before it can grow tall.\n\\b\n\\q",
  "27": "But I know everything about you.\n\\q2 I know when you are in your house \n\\q3 and when you go outside;\n\\q2 I also know that you are raging against me.\n\\q",
  "28": "So, because you have raged against me,\n\\q2 and because I have heard you do this,\n\\q it will be as though I will put a hook in your nose,\n\\q2 and I will put an iron bit in your mouth, \n\\q in order that I can take you where I want you to go.\n\\q2 I will force you to return to your own country\n\\q on the same road on which you came here, \n\\q2 without conquering Jerusalem.'\n\\q \n\\q",
  "29": "Now I say this to Hezekiah: \n\\q2 'This is what will happen to prove that I am telling the truth:\n\\q This year and next year you and your people \n\\q2 will be able to harvest only wild grain.\n\\q But the following year, you Israelites will be able \n\\q2 to plant grain and harvest it, \n\\q2 and to plant vineyards and eat the grapes.\n\\q",
  "30": "The people in Judah who remain alive will prosper \n\\q2 and have many children;\n\\q they will be like plants whose roots go deep down \n\\q2 into the ground and which produce much .\n\\q",
  "31": "There will be many people in Jerusalem \n\\q2 who will remain alive,\n\\q because I, Yahweh, commander of the armies, \n\\q2 have planned it to happen.\n\\q",
  "32": "So this is what I, Yahweh, say \n\\q2 about the king of Assyria:\n\\q \"His armies will not enter this city;\n\\q2 they will not even shoot any arrows into it.\n\\q His soldiers will not march outside the city gates carrying shields,\n\\q2 and they will not even build high mounds of earth\n\\q3 against the city walls\n\\q3 to enable them to attack the city.\n\\q",
  "33": "Their king will return to his own country\n\\q2 on the same road on which he came here.\n\\q2 He will not enter this city.\n\\q That will happen because I, Yahweh, have said it!\n\\q",

  "37": "One day, when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his two sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords. Then they escaped and went to the region of Ararat, northwest of Nineveh. And another of Sennacherib's sons, Esarhaddon, became the king of Assyria."
