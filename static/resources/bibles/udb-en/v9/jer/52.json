  "7": "Then the soldiers of Babylonia broke through a section of the city wall, and all the Israelite soldiers fled. But because the city was surrounded by soldiers from Babylonia, Zedekiah and the Israelite soldiers waited until it became dark. Then they left the city through the gate between the two walls behind the king's garden. Then they ran toward the plain along the Jordan.",

  "19": "Nebuzaradan also told his soldiers to take away the small bowls, the dishes for burning incense, the basins, pots, lampstands, bowls for incense, and the bowls used for pouring out the wine offerings. They took all the other items that were made of pure gold or silver.",
  "20": "The bronze from the two pillars, the large water tank and the twelve statues of oxen that were beneath it, and the water carts, was more than they could weigh. Those things had been made for the temple during the time that Solomon was the king.",
  "21": "Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet around. They were hollow, and each had sides that were 3 inches thick.",
