  "3": "The army of a nation will come from the north to attack Babylon\n\\q2 and destroy the city very thoroughly,\n\\q1 with the result that no one will live there again.\n\\q2 Both people and animals will run away.\"\n\\q1",
  "4": "\"But I, Yahweh, say that in the future, when that is about to happen,\n\\q2 the people of Israel and the people of Judah will join together.\n\\q1 They will be weeping\n\\q2 and wanting to worship me, their God.\n\\q1",
  "5": "They will inquire about the road to Jerusalem,\n\\q2 and then they will start traveling toward it.\n\\q1 They will say to each other,\n\\q2 'We must return to Yahweh again!'\n\\q2 They will make an everlasting agreement with me that they will never forget.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "6": "My people have been like lost sheep.\n\\q2 Their leaders have caused them to abandon me\n\\q2 like shepherds who have allowed their sheep to wander in the hills and mountains.\n\\q1 My people are like sheep\n\\q2 that do not know the path to return to the sheepfold.\n\\q1",
  "7": "All their enemies who found them attacked them.\n\\q2 They said, 'We did not sin by attacking them,\n\\q1 because they sinned against Yahweh;\n\\q2 he is the one who provides what they need;\n\\q1 he is the one to whom they should have remained faithful;\n\\q2 he is the one whom their ancestors confidently expected to help them.'\n\\b\n\\q1",

  "13": "Because I, Yahweh, am angry with you people of Babylon,\n\\q2 I will cause your city to become completely deserted.\n\\q1 All who pass by will be horrified\n\\q2 and will gasp because of the destruction there.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "14": "All you nations that surround Babylon,\n\\q2 prepare to attack it!\n\\q1 Tell your archers to shoot at their enemies;\n\\q2 shoot all of your arrows at them and do not hold back,\n\\q2 because the people of Babylon have sinned against me, Yahweh.\n\\q1",

  "19": "And I will bring the people of Israel back to their own land\n\\q2 where they will eat the food that grows in the fields of the regions of Carmel and Bashan,\n\\q1 and the people in the hill areas of Ephraim and Gilead will have all they want to eat.\n\\q1",

  "35": "He will send enemy soldiers carrying swords to strike the people of Babylonia;\n\\q2 they will strike the officials and wise men\n\\q2 and all the other people who live in Babylon.\n\\q1",
  "36": "They will strike their false prophets with swords\n\\q2 and they will become foolish.\n\\q1 They will strike the strongest warriors of Babylonia,\n\\q2 and they will all be terrified.\n\\q1",
  "37": "They will strike their horses and chariots\n\\q2 and the foreign mercenaries who are in the army of Babylonia,\n\\q2 and they will all become as weak as women.\n\\q1 They will seize all the valuable things there in Babylon\n\\q2 and take them away.\n\\q1",
  "38": "Yahweh will cause the streams to become dry.\n\\q1 He will do all those things because the entire land of Babylonia is filled with idols,\n\\q2 and those horrible idols have caused the people who worship them to become crazy.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "39": "Soon only jackals and other wild creatures will live there;\n\\q2 and it will be a place where ostriches live.\n\\q1 People will never live there again;\n\\q2 it will be uninhabited forever .\n\\q1",

  "42": "Their army has bows and arrows and spears;\n\\q2 they are very cruel, and do not act mercifully to anyone.\n\\q1 As they ride along on their horses,\n\\q2 the sound of the horses' hooves is like the roaring of the ocean waves;\n\\q1 they are riding in battle formation\n\\q2 to attack you, you people of Babylon.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "43": "The king of Babylon heard their report,\n\\q1 \"The enemy is approaching.\"\n\\q2 So he was frightened and became weak.\n\\q1 Fear and anguish gripped him,\n\\q2 like a woman who is about to give birth to a baby.\"\n\\q1",
  "44": "I, Yahweh, will come to Babylon suddenly like a lion comes out of the jungle\n\\q2 and leaps on the sheep that are eating the good pastureland.\n\\q1 I will quickly chase the people of Babylonia from their land.\n\\q2 And then I will appoint for them a leader whom I will choose;\n\\q1 I will do that because there is no one like me who can say that what I have done is not right.\n\\q2 No ruler can oppose me.\n\\q1",
