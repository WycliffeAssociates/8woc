  "6": "But think about this:\n\\q1 Men certainly do not give birth to babies.\n\\q1 Therefore, why do strong men stand there,\n\\q2 with their faces very white,\n\\q1 with their hands pressed against their stomachs,\n\\q2 like women who are about to give birth to babies?\n\\q1",
  "7": "Terrible things will soon happen;\n\\q2 That will be a terrible day!\n\\q2 There has never been such a time.\n\\q1 It will be a time when my Israelite people will experience great trouble,\n\\q2 but finally they will be saved from their sufferings.\"\n\\q1",
