  "16": "\"Say this to Ebed Melech, the official from Ethiopia: 'This is what Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the God whom Israel worships, says: I will do to this city everything that I said that I would do. I will not enable the people to prosper; I will cause them to experience disasters. You will see Jerusalem being destroyed,",

  "18": "You trusted me, so I will save you. You will not be killed by our enemies' swords; you will remain alive. That will surely happen because I, Yahweh, have said it.'\""
