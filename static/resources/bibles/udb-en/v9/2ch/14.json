  "7": "Asa said to the people of Judah, \"We should protect these towns by building walls around them, with watchtowers and gates that have bars.

We requested him for his help, and he has given us peace in our entire country.\" So they built buildings and succeeded in what they did.",

They were completely defeated by Yahweh and his army, and the men of Judah carried away a great amount of their possessions.",
