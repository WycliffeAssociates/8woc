  "2": "So Asa told his workers to take all the silver and gold that was in the storerooms of the temple and in his own palace, and take and give it to Ben Hadad, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus. He sent him a message, saying,",
  "3": "\"I want there to be a peace treaty between me and you, like there was between my father and your father. Look, I am sending you much silver and gold. So please cancel the treaty that you have made with Baasha, the king of Israel, in order that he will take his soldiers away from attacking mine, because he will be afraid of your army.\"",
  "4": "Ben Hadad agreed to do what King Asa suggested. He sent the commanders of his armies with their soldiers to attack some of the towns in Israel. They captured Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the cities in the tribe of Naphtali where supplies were kept.",

  "14": "People buried him in the tomb that his workers had made for him in the part of Jerusalem called \"the city of David.\" They laid his corpse on a bed covered with spices and various perfumes that had been mixed together. They also lit a huge fire to honor him."
