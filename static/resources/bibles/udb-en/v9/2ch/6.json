  "8": "But Yahweh said to him, 'It is good that you wanted to build a house for me.",
  "9": "However, you are not the one who I want to build the temple, It is one of your own sons who will build it.'\ni",
  "10": "And Yahweh has done what he promised to do. I have become the king of Israel to rule after my father, and I am ruling the people, as Yahweh promised, and I have arranged for this temple to be built for us to worship Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelites belong.",
  "11": "I have put the sacred chest in the temple, in which are the stone tablets showing the covenant that Yahweh made with us Israelite people.\"",
  "12": "Then Solomon stood in front of the altar that was in front of the people of Israel who had gathered there. He spread out his hands as he began to pray.",
  "13": "Now His workers had built a bronze platform there for him to stand on, which was about 2.3 meters square and about 1.5 meters high. They had put it in the outer courtyard.

  "23": "then please listen from heaven and decide who is telling the truth. Then punish the person who is guilty as he deserves to be punished, and do good to the other person as a reward for his innocence.\ni",
  "24": "And suppose that your Israelite people are defeated by their enemies because they sinned against you, and forced to go to some distant country.

  "31": "Do this in order that they might honor you and conduct their lives as you want them to, all the time that they live in this land that you gave to our ancestors.\ni",
  "32": "There will be some foreigners who do not belong to your Israelite people who have come here from countries far away because they have heard that you are very great and powerful. If they turn toward this temple and pray,",
  "33": "then from your home in heaven please listen to their prayer and do for them what they request you to do. Do that in order that all the people groups in the world will honor and obey you, as your people of Israel do. And do this so that they will know that you are present in this temple that I have built.\ni",
  "34": "When you send your people to go and attack their enemies, if they pray to you, no matter where they are, and if they turn toward this city that you have chosen and toward this temple that I have caused to be built to honor you,",
  "35": "then will you please listen from heaven to their prayers. Listen to what they plead for you to do, and give them help.\ni",
  "36": "It is true that everyone sins. So when your people sin against you, and you become angry with them, you might allow their enemies to capture them and take them to their countries, even to countries that are far away.",
