  "4": "My people's infants' tongues cling to the roofs of their mouths\n\\q2 because they are extremely thirsty;\n\\q1 the children plead for some food,\n\\q2 but no one gives them any.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "5": "People who previously ate fine food\n\\q2 are now starving in the streets;\n\\q1 those who previously wore fine clothes \n\\q2 now paw through rubbish heaps to find some food.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "6": "The people of Sodom died very suddenly in a disaster,\n\\q2 and there was no one to rescue them;\n\\q1 but God has punished my people\n\\q2 more severely than the people of Sodom.\n\\b\n\\q1",
  "7": "Our leaders were could be compare to snow or milk,\n\\q2  so they were clean and spotless.\n\\q1 Their physical bodies were healthy, \n\\q2 and their health and strength could compare \n\\q2 to brilliance and beauty of sapphires. \n\\b\n\\q1",
