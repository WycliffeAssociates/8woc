  "16": "So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, El Nathan, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were all leaders of the people. I also summoned Joiarib \nand another El Nathan, who were teachers.",

  "22": "Previously we had told the king that our God takes care of all those who truly trust in him, but that he becomes very angry with those who refuse to obey him. So I would have been ashamed \nto ask the king to send soldiers and men riding on horses to protect us from our enemies while we were traveling along the road.",

  "31": "On the twelfth day of the first month, we left the Ahava Canal and started to travel to Jerusalem. Our God took care of us, and while we traveled, he prevented our enemies and bandits from attacking us.",
  "32": "After we arrived in Jerusalem, we rested for three days.",
  "33": "Then on the fourth day we went to the temple. There the silver and gold and the other items were weighed and given to the priest Meremoth son of Uriah. Eleazar the son of Phinehas and two descendants of Levi, Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui, were with him.",
  "34": "They counted everything, and wrote down how much they weighed, and wrote a description of each item.",
  "35": "We who had returned from Babylonia offered to God sacrifices on the altar. We offered twelve bulls for all us Israelite people.

  "36": "Some of us who returned from Babylonia took to the governors and other officials of the province west of the Euphrates River the letter that the king had given to us. After they read the \nletter, they did all that they were able to do for us Israelite people and for the temple of God.\""
