  "6": "Ezra was a man who knew the laws that Moses wrote very well. Those were the laws that Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given to the Israelite people. He left Babylon after the king had told people\nto give him anything he requested. Indeed, Yahweh helped Ezra very much in all these matters.",
  "7": "Some of the priests, some descendants of Levi, some singers, some gatekeepers, and some men who worked in the temple, and some other Israelite people went up with Ezra to \nJerusalem. That was during the seventh year that Artaxerxes was the king of Persia.",

  "13": "Ezra, I command that when you return to Jerusalem, any of the Israelite people in my kingdom who want to be allowed to go with you. That includes any priests and descendants of Levi \nwho will work in the temple who want to go.",
  "14": "I, along with my seven counselors, am sending you to Jerusalem, in order that you can determine what is happening there and in other towns in Judah. You are taking with you a copy \nof God's laws; make sure that the people are doing everything that is written in those laws.",
  "15": "We are also telling you to take with you the silver and gold that I and my advisors are wanting to give to you, in order that you will present it as an offering to the God of Israel \nwho lives in Jerusalem.",
  "16": "You should also take any silver and gold that the people in the entire Babylonia province give to you, and the money that the priests and other Israelite people have happily said that they \nwould give to you to be offerings for building the temple of their God in Jerusalem.",
  "17": "With this money, you should buy the bulls, rams, lambs, and the grain and wine that the priests will burn on the altar outside the temple of your God in Jerusalem.",

  "23": "Be sure that you provide whatever their God requires for his temple, because we certainly do not want him to be angry with me or with my descendants who will later be kings.",
  "24": "We are also commanding that none of the priests, descendants of Levi who work in the temple, musicians, temple guards, or other men who work in the temple, will be required to \npay any taxes.",
  "25": "Ezra, your God has enabled you to become very wise. Using that wisdom, appoint men in the province west of the Euphrates River who will judge cases involving the people, and \nmen who will judge cases involving the government. You must appoint men who know the laws of your God. All of you must teach God's laws to others who do not know them.",
  "26": "Everyone who does not obey God's laws or the laws of my government must be punished severely. Some of them will be executed, some will be put in prison, some will be sent out \nof the country or have all their property taken away from them.\"",
