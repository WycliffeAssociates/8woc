I also saw the people who had overcome the beast by not worshiping it or its image, and by not allowing its servant to mark them with the number that represents the beast's name.

They sang this to praise the Lamb in this way:\n\\q1 \"Lord God, who rules over everything,\n\\q1 whatever you do is powerful and marvelous!\n\\q1 You always act righteously and truthfully.\n\\q1 You are king forever of all the people-groups!\n\\q1",
  "4": "O Lord, everyone will fear you and honor you because you alone are holy.\n\\q1 All people-groups will come and bow down before you\n\\q1 because you have shown that you have judged everyone in the right way.\"",

  "8": "The temple was filled with smoke that symbolized the presence of the glorious and all-powerful God. No one was able to enter the temple until the seven angels finished punishing the people of the earth in seven different ways."
