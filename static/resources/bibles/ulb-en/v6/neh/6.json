  "4": "They sent me the same message four times, and I answered them the same way each time.",
  "5": "Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.",
  "6": "In it was written,\ni \"It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel, for that is why you are rebuilding the wall. From what these reports say, you are about to become their king.",
