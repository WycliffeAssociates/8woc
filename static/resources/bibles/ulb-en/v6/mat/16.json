  "10": "Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?",
  "11": "How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\"",
  "12": "Then they understood that he was not telling them to beware of yeast in bread, but to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
  "13": "Now when Jesus came to the regions near Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\"",
