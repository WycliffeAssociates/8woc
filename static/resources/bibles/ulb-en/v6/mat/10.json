  "3": "Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;",
  "4": "Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who would betray him.",
  "5": "These twelve Jesus sent out. He instructed them and said, \"Do not go to any place where Gentiles live, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.",
  "6": "Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel;",
  "7": "and as you go, preach and say, 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'",

  "13": "If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace come back to you.",
  "14": "As for those who do not receive you or listen to your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.",
  "15": "Truly I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.",

  "20": "For it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who will speak in you.",

  "24": "A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master.",
  "25": "It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse would be the names they call the members of his household!",

  "37": "He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.",
  "38": "He who does not pick up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.",
