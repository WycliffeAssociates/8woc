  "1": "It came about that when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.",

  "6": "Blessed is anyone who is not offended by me.\"",
  "7": "As these men went on their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, \"What did you go out in the desert to see—a reed being shaken by the wind?",

  "11": "I say to you truly, among those born of women no one is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.",
