  "3": "Give the heifer to Eleazar the priest. He must bring it outside the camp, and someone must kill it in front of him.",
  "4": "Eleazar the priest must take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting.",

  "9": "Someone who is clean must gather up the heifer's ashes and put them outside the camp in a clean place. These ashes must be kept for the community of the people of Israel. They will mix the ashes with water for purification from sin, since the ashes were from a sin offering.",

  "18": "Someone who is clean must then take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the containers inside the tent, on the persons who were there, and on anyone who touched the bone, the one who was killed, the one who died, or the grave.",
  "19": "On the third day and on the seventh day, the clean person must sprinkle the unclean person. On the seventh day the unclean person must purify himself. He must wash his clothes and bathe in water. At evening he will become clean.",
  "20": "But anyone who remains unclean, who refuses to purify himself—that person will be cut off from the community, because he has defiled Yahweh's sanctuary. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he remains unclean.",
  "21": "This will be an ongoing law concerning these situations. The one who sprinkles the water for impurity must wash his clothes. The one who touches the water for impurity will become unclean until evening.",
  "22": "Whatever the unclean person touches will become unclean. The person who touches it will become unclean until evening.\""
