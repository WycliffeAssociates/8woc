  "2": "\"Speak to the people of Israel, saying, 'Appoint the cities of refuge of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses.",
  "3": "Do this so that one who unintentionally kills a person can go there. These cities will be a place of refuge from anyone who seeks to avenge the blood of a person who was killed.",
  "4": "He will run to one of those cities and will stand at the entrance of the city gate, and explain his case to the elders of that city. Then they will take him into the city and give him a place for him to live among them.",
  "5": "If one of them comes to try to avenge the blood of the person who was killed, then the people of the city must not hand the one who killed him over to the authorities. They must not do this because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, and he had no hatred toward him in the past.",
  "6": "He must stay in that city until he has stood before the assembly for judgment, until the death of the one who was serving as high priest in those days. Then the one who had accidentally killed the person may return to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.'\"",

This person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood that was shed, until the accused person would first stand before the assembly."
