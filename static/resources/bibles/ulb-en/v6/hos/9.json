  "3": "They will not continue to live in Yahweh's land;\n\\q instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt,\n\\q and one day they will eat unclean food in Assyria.\n\\q",
  "4": "They will pour out no wine offerings to Yahweh,\n\\q neither will they be pleasing to him.\n\\q Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners' food:\n\\q all who eat it will be defiled.\n\\q For their food will be for themselves only;\n\\q it will not come into the house of Yahweh.",

  "7": "The days for punishment are coming;\n\\q the days for retribution are coming.\n\\q Let all Israel know these things.\n\\q The prophet is a fool,\n\\q and the inspired man is insane,\n\\q because of your great iniquity\n\\q and great hostility.",
