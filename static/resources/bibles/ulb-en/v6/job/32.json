  "3": "Elihu's anger was also kindled against his three friends because they had found no answer to Job, and yet they had condemned Job.",
  "4": "Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the other men were older than he.",
  "5": "However, when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, his anger was kindled.",
  "6": "Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite spoke up and said,\n\\q \"I am young, and you are very old.\n\\q That is why I held back and did not dare to tell you my own opinion.\n\\q",
