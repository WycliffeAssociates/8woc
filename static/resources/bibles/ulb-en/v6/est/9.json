  "11": "That day the number of those killed in the fortress of Susa, was reported to the king.",
  "12": "The king said to Queen Esther, \"The Jews have killed five hundred men in the fortress of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be granted you. What is your request? It will be granted to you.\"",

  "17": "This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness.",
  "18": "But the Jews who were in Susa assembled together on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days. On the fifteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.",
  "19": "That is why the Jews of the villages, who make their homes in the rural towns, observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of gladness and feasting, and as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another.",
  "20": "Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,",
  "21": "obligating them to keep the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of Adar every year.",
  "22": "These were the days when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and the month when their sorrow turned to joy, and mourning into a day of celebration. They were to make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending gifts of food to one another, and gifts to the poor.",
  "23": "So the Jews continued the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.",
  "24": "At that time Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and he threw Pur (that is, he threw lots), to crush and destroy them.",
  "25": "But when the matter came before the king, he gave orders by letters that the wicked plan Haman developed against the Jews should come back on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.",
