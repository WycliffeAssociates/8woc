  "4": "Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak. We speak, not to please men, but to please God. He is the one who examines our hearts.",
  "5": "For we did not at any time use words as flattery, as you know, nor as a pretext for covetousness, as God is our witness.",
  "6": "Nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others. We could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ.",
