  "1": "Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread was approaching, which is called the Passover.",
  "2": "The chief priests and the scribes discussed how they could put Jesus to death, for they were afraid of the people.",
  "3": "Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve.",
  "4": "Judas went to the chief priests and captains and discussed with them how he would betray Jesus to them.",
  "5": "They were glad, and agreed to give him money.",
  "6": "He consented, and looked for an opportunity to deliver him to them away from the crowd.",
  "7": "The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lamb must be sacrificed.",
  "8": "Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, so that we may eat it.\"",
  "9": "They asked him, \"Where do you want us to make preparations?\"",
  "10": "He answered them, \"Listen, when you have entered the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he goes into.",

  "25": "He said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles are masters over them, and the ones who have authority over them are referred to as those who do good to their people.",
  "26": "But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.",
  "27": "For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.",

  "34": "Jesus replied, \"I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, before you deny three times that you know me.\"",
  "35": "Then Jesus said to them, \"When I sent you out without a purse, a bag of provisions, or shoes, did you lack anything?\" They answered, \"Nothing.\"",
  "36": "Then he said to them, \"But now, the one who has a purse, let him take it, and also a bag of provisions. The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.",
  "37": "For I say to you, what is written about me must be fulfilled, 'He was regarded as one of the lawless.' For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled.\"",
  "38": "Then they said, \"Lord, look! Here are two swords.\" He said to them, \"It is enough.\"",

  "51": "Jesus said, \"That is enough!\" He touched his ear, and healed him.",
  "52": "Jesus said to the chief priests, to the captains of the temple, and to elders who came against him, \"Do you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?",
  "53": "When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.\"",
  "54": "Seizing him, they led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed from a distance.",
  "55": "After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.",
  "56": "A certain female servant saw him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looked straight at him and said, \"This man also was with him.\"",
  "57": "But Peter denied it, saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\"",
