  "22": "The nobleman said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a severe man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.",
  "23": "Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I would have collected it with interest?'",
