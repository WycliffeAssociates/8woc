  "13": "He placed his hands on her, and immediately she was straightened up and she glorified God.",
  "14": "But the synagogue ruler was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. So the ruler answered and said to the crowd, \"There are six days in which it is necessary to work. Come and be healed then, not on the Sabbath day.\"",
