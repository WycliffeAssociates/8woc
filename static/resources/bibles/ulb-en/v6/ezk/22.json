  "4": "You are guilty by the blood that you have poured out, and are made unclean by the idols that you have made. For you have drawn your days close and approached your final years. Therefore I will make you a reproach to the nations and a derision in the sight of every land.",
  "5": "Both those who are near and those who are far away from you will mock you, you unclean city, with the reputation known everywhere as being full of confusion.",
  "6": "Behold! The rulers of Israel, each one by his own power, have come to you to pour out blood.",
  "7": "They have dishonored fathers and mothers within you, and they have performed oppression on the foreigners in your midst. They have mistreated the orphans and the widows within you.",
