  "33": "People give payment to every prostitute, but you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your acts of prostitution.",

  "43": "Because you did not call to mind the days of your youth and have made me shake with anger because of all these things, therefore, behold! I myself will bring down on your own head the punishment for what you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. Have you not added prostitution to all your other detestable practices?",
  "44": "Behold! Everyone who speaks proverbs concerning you will say, \"As the mother is, so also is her daughter.\"",
  "45": "You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite.",

  "50": "She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions before me, so I took them away just as you have seen.",
  "51": "Neither did Samaria commit even half of your sins; instead, you have done many more disgusting things than they did, and you have shown that your sisters were better than you because of all the disgusting things that you do!",

Your sisters now seem better than you. Especially you, show your own shame, for in this way you have shown that your sisters were better than you.",
  "53": "For I will restore their fortunes—the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters; but your fortunes will be among them.",
  "54": "On account of these things you will show your shame; you will be humiliated because of everything that you have done, and in this way you will be a comfort to them.",
  "55": "So your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former condition, and Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former estate. Then you and your daughters will be restored to your former condition.",
  "56": "Sodom your sister was not even mentioned by your mouth in the days when you were proud,",

  "61": "Then you will call to mind your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters and your younger sisters. I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant.",
  "62": "I myself will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.",
  "63": "Because of these things, you will call everything to mind and be ashamed, so you will no longer open your mouth to speak because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for all that you have done—this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration.'\""
