  "3": "Some of those rooms faced the inner courtyard and were twenty cubits away from the sanctuary. There were three levels of rooms, and the ones above looked down on the ones below and were open to them, having a walkway. Some of the rooms looked out onto the outer courtyard.",

The rooms' doors were toward the north.\n\\f + \\ft Some ancient versions and many modern versions read \\fqa one hundred cubits \\fqa* . Ancient Hebrew copies and some modern versions read read \\fqa one cubit \\fqa* . \\f*",
  "5": "But the upper halls were smaller, for the walkways took away from them more space than they did in the lowest and middle levels of the building.",
  "6": "For the halls on the third story had no columns, unlike the courtyards, which did have columns. So the highest level's rooms were  smaller in size compared to the rooms in the lowest and middle levels.",

  "12": "On the south side were doors into rooms that were just the same as on the north side. A passage on the inside had a door at its head, and the passage opened into the various rooms. On the east side there was a doorway into the passage at one end.",
  "13": "Then the man said to me, \"The northern rooms and the southern rooms that are in front of the outer courtyard are holy rooms where the priests who work nearest to Yahweh may eat the most holy food. They will put the most holy things there—the food offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for this is a holy place.",
  "14": "When the priests enter there, they must not go out of the holy place to the outer court, without laying aside the clothes in which they served, since these are holy. So they must dress in other clothes before going near the people.\"",
