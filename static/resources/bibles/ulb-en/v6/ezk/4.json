  "3": "Then take for yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and the city and set your face against it, for it will be under siege, and you are to put  the siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.",

  "13": "For Yahweh says, \"This means that the bread that the people of Israel will eat will be unclean, there among the nations where I will banish them.\"",
  "14": "But I said, \"Alas, Lord Yahweh! I have never been unclean! I have never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals, from my youth until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth!\"",
  "15": "So he said to me, \"Look! I have given you cow manure instead of human dung so you can prepare your bread over that.\"",
  "16": "He also said to me, \"Son of man! Behold! I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread while rationing it in anxiety and drink water while rationing it in trembling.",
  "17": "Because they will lack bread and water, every man will be dismayed at his brother and waste away because of their iniquity.\""
