  "2": "One person has faith to eat anything, another who is weak eats only vegetables.",
  "3": "May the one who eats everything not despise the one who does not; and may the one who does not eat everything not judge the other who eats everything. For God has accepted him.",
  "4": "Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to someone else? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.",
  "5": "One person values one day above another. Another values every day equally. Let each person be convinced in his own mind.",
  "6": "He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord; and he who eats, eats for the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who does not eat, refrains from eating for the Lord. He also gives thanks to God.",
  "7": "For none of us lives for himself, and none dies for himself.",
  "8": "For if we live, we live for the Lord. And if we die, we die for the Lord. Then whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.",

  "19": "So then, let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another.",
  "20": "Do not destroy the work of God because of food. All things are indeed clean, but it is evil for that person who eats and causes him to stumble.",
  "21": "It is good not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother takes offense.",
