  "5": "Theirs are the ancestors from whom Christ has come with respect to the flesh—he who is God over all. May he be praised forever. Amen.",
  "6": "But it is not as though the promises of God have failed. For it is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel.",

  "13": "It is just as had been written: \"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\"",
  "14": "What then will we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be.",

  "18": "So then, God has mercy on whom he wishes, and whom he wishes, he makes stubborn.",

  "21": "Does the potter not have the right over the clay to make from the same lump a container for special use, and another container for daily use?",
  "22": "What if God, who is willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience containers of wrath prepared for destruction?",
  "23": "What if he did this in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon containers of mercy, which he had previously prepared for glory?",
  "24": "What if he did this also for us, whom he also called, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles?",
  "25": "As he says also in Hosea:\n\\q \"I will call my people who were not my people,\n\\q and her beloved who was not beloved.\n\\q",
