  "4": "I thought to inform you and say to you, 'Buy it in the presence of those who are sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you wish to redeem it, redeem it.

  "14": "The women said to Naomi, \"May Yahweh be blessed, who has not left you today without a near kinsman, this baby. May his name be famous in Israel.",
  "15": "May he be for you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.\"",
