  "3": "Why do you make me see iniquity and look upon wrongdoing?\n\\q Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and contention rises up.\n\\q",
  "4": "Therefore the law is weakened, and justice does not last for any time.\n\\q For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore false justice goes out.\"",
  "5": "\"Look at the nations and examine them; be amazed and astonished!\n\\q For I am surely about to do something in your days that you will not believe when it is reported to you.\n\\q",

  "7": "They are terrifying and fearsome; their judgment and splendor proceed from themselves.",

  "17": "Will they therefore empty their fishing nets and continue to slaughter the nations, feeling no compassion?\"",
