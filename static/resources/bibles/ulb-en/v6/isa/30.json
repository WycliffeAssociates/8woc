  "2": "They set out to go down into Egypt, but have not asked for my direction.\n\\q1 They seek protection from Pharaoh and take refuge in the shadow of Egypt.",
  "3": "Therefore Pharaoh's protection will be your shame,\n\\q1 and the refuge in Egypt's shade, your humiliation,\n\\q1",
  "4": "although their princes are at Zoan, and their messengers have come to Hanes.\n\\q1",
  "5": "They will all be ashamed because of a people who cannot help them,\n\\q1 who are neither help nor aid, but a shame, and even a disgrace.\"",

  "11": "Turn aside from the way, stray off the path;\n\\q1 cause the Holy One of Israel to cease speaking before our face.\"",
  "12": "Therefore the Holy One of Israel says,\n\\q1 \"Because you reject this word\n\\q1 and trust in oppression and deceit and lean on it,\n\\q1",
