  "1": "Look, Yahweh's hand is not so short that it cannot save; nor his ear so dull, that it cannot hear.\n\\q1",
  "2": "Your sinful acts, however, have separated you from your God,\n\\q1 and your sins have made him hide his face from you and from hearing you.",
  "3": "For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with sin.\n\\q1 Your lips speak lies and your tongue speaks\nmaliciously.\n\\q1",
  "4": "No one calls in righteousness, and none pleads his case in truth.\n\\q1 They trust in empty words, and tell lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to sin.",
  "5": "They hatch eggs of a poisonous snake and weave a spider's web.\n\\q1 Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake.\n\\q1",
  "6": "Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works.\n\\q1 Their works are works of sin, and deeds of violence are in their hands.",
  "7": "Their feet run to evil, and they run to pour out innocent blood.\n\\q1 Their thoughts are thoughts of sin; violence\nand destruction are their roads.\n\\q1",
  "8": "The way of peace they do not know, and there is no justice in their paths.\n\\q1 They have made crooked paths; whoever\ntravels these paths does not know peace.",
  "9": "Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness reach us.\n\\q1 We wait for light, but see darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness.\n\\q1",
  "10": "We grope for the wall like the blind, like those who cannot see.\n\\q1 We stumble at noonday as in the twilight;\namong the strong we are like dead men.",
  "11": "We growl like bears and moan like doves;\n\\q1 we wait for justice, but there is none; for rescue, but it is far from us.",
  "12": "For our many transgressions are before you, and our sins testify against us;\n\\q1 for our transgressions are with us, and we know our sins.\n\\q1",
  "13": "We have rebelled, denying Yahweh and turning away from following our God.\n\\q1 We have spoken extortion and turning aside, conceived complaining from the heart and words of lying.",
  "14": "Justice is driven back, and righteousness stands far off;\n\\q1 for truth stumbles in the public square, and right cannot come.\n\\q1",
  "15": "Trustworthiness has gone away, and he who turns away from evil makes himself a victim.\n\\q1 Yahweh saw it and was displeased that there was no justice.",
  "16": "He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intervene.\n\\q1 Therefore his own arm brought salvation\nfor him, and his righteousness sustained him.",
  "17": "He put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head.\n\\q1 He clothed himself with garments of vengeance and wore zeal as a mantle.\n\\q1",
  "18": "He repaid them for what they had done, angry judgment to his adversaries, vengeance to his enemies, to the islands punishment as their reward.",
  "19": "So they will fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the sun's rising; for he will come as a\nrushing stream, driven by the breath of Yahweh.\n\\q1",
  "20": "\"A redeemer will come to Zion and to those who turn from their rebellious deeds in Jacob—this is Yahweh's declaration.",
