  "1": "I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.",
  "2": "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago who—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third heaven.",
  "3": "And I know that this man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—",
  "4": "was caught up into paradise and heard things too sacred for anyone to say.",
  "5": "On behalf of such a person I will boast. But on behalf of myself I will not boast, except about my weaknesses.",
  "6": "If I wanted to boast, I would not be foolish, for I would be speaking the truth. But I will keep from boasting, so that no one will think more of me than what is seen in me or heard from me.",
  "7": "I will also keep from boasting because of the extraordinary kind of those revelations. Therefore, so I would not be puffed up with pride, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to harass me, so I would not become too proud.",
  "8": "Three times I begged the Lord about this, for him to take it away from me.",
  "9": "But he said to me, \"My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.\" So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might reside on me.",
  "10": "Therefore I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.",
  "11": "I have become a fool! You forced me to this, for I should have been praised by you. For I was not at all inferior to the so-called super-apostles, even though I am nothing.",
  "12": "The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with complete patience, signs and wonders and mighty deeds.",
  "13": "For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me for this wrong!",
  "14": "Look! I am ready to come to you a third time. I will not be a burden to you, for I do not want what is yours. I want you. For children should not save up for the parents. Instead, the parents should save up for the children.",
  "15": "I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?",
  "16": "But as it is, I did not burden you. But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.",
  "17": "Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent to you?",
  "18": "I urged Titus to go to you, and I sent the other brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?",
  "19": "Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you? In the sight of God, we have in Christ been saying everything for your strengthening.",
  "20": "For I fear that when I come I may not find you as I wish. I fear that you might not find me as you wish. I fear that there may be arguments, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, gossip, pride, and disorder.",
  "21": "I fear that when I come back, my God might humble me before you. I fear that I might be grieved by many of those who have sinned before now, and who did not repent of the impurity and sexual immorality and lustful indulgence that they practiced."
