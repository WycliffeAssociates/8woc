  "1": "Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.",
  "2": "He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like the disgusting things of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel.",

  "7": "The carved figure of Asherah that he had made, he placed it in the house of Yahweh. It was about this house that Yahweh had spoken to David and Solomon his son; he had said: \"It is in this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, that I will put my name forever.",
  "8": "I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land that I gave to their ancestors, if they will only be careful to obey all that I have commanded them, and to follow all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.\"",
  "9": "But the people did not listen, and Manasseh led them to do evil even more than the nations that Yahweh had destroyed before the people of Israel.",
  "10": "So Yahweh spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,",
  "11": "\"Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these disgusting things, and has acted wickedly more than all that the Amorites who were before him did, and has also made Judah sin with his idols,",
  "12": "therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this: Look, I am about to bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears of it, both his ears will tingle.",

  "14": "I will throw off the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies. They will become victims and plunder for all their enemies,",
  "15": "because they have done what is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their ancestors came out of Egypt, to this day.\"",
  "16": "Moreover, Manasseh shed much innocent blood, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another with death. This was in addition to the sin by which he made Judah to sin, when they did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh.",
  "17": "As for the other matters concerning Manasseh, all that he did, and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?",
