  "7": "So Isaiah said, \"Take a lump of figs.\" They did so and put it on his boil, and he recovered.",
  "8": "Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \"What will be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I should go up to the temple of Yahweh on the third day?\"",
  "9": "Isaiah replied, \"This will be the sign for you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that he has spoken. Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?\"",
  "10": "Hezekiah answered, \"It is an easy thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. No, let the shadow go backward ten steps.\"",

  "12": "At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.",
  "13": "Hezekiah listened to those letters, and then showed the messengers all the palace and his valuable things, the silver, the gold, the spices and precious oil, and the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them.",
  "14": "Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, \"What did these men say to you? Where did they come from?\" Hezekiah said, \"They came from the distant country of Babylon.\"",
  "15": "Isaiah asked, \"What have they seen in your house?\" Hezekiah answered, \"They have seen everything in my house. There is nothing among my valuable things that I have not shown them.\"",
