  "7": "Then the city was broken into, and all the fighting men fled and went out of the city at night by the way of the gate that was between the two walls, by the king's garden, although the Chaldeans were all around the city. So they went in the direction of the Arabah.",
  "8": "But the army of Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of the Jordan River valley near Jericho. All his army was scattered away from him.",

  "15": "As for the poorest people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen—\nNebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguard, took some of them away into exile.",
  "16": "But Nebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguard, left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.",
  "17": "As for the bronze pillars that belonged to the house of Yahweh, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of\nYahweh, the Chaldeans broke them into pieces and carried all the bronze back to Babylon.",
  "18": "The pots, shovels, lamp trimmers, bowls, and all the utensils of bronze with which the priests had served in the temple—the Chaldeans took them all away.",
  "19": "The basins and the incense burners, the bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and basins that were made of gold, and those made of silver—the captain of the king's guard took them away as well.",
  "20": "The two pillars, the sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the stands, things that Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, contained more bronze than could be weighed.",
  "21": "The pillars were eighteen cubits high each, and a line around each one measured twelve cubits. Each was four fingers thick and hollow.",
  "22": "A capital of bronze was on top of it. The capital was five cubits high, with latticework and pomegranates all around. It was all made of bronze. The other pillar and its pomegranates were the same as the first.",
  "23": "So there were ninety-six pomegranates on the capital's sides, and one hundred pomegranates above the surrounding latticework.",
  "24": "The commander of the bodyguard took prisoner Seraiah, the high priest, together with Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three gatekeepers.",
  "25": "From the city he took prisoner an officer who was in charge of soldiers, and seven men of those who advised the king, who were still in the city. He also took prisoner the king's army officer responsible for drafting men into the army, along with sixty important men from the land who were in the city.",
  "26": "Then Nebuzaradan, the commander of the bodyguard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.",
  "27": "The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. In this way, Judah went out of its land into exile.",
  "28": "These were the people who Nebuchadnezzar exiled: in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans.",
  "29": "In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he took 832 people from Jerusalem.",

This happened in the year that Evil-Merodach began to reign.",
  "32": "He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat more honorable than that of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.",
  "33": "Evil-Merodach removed Jehoiachin's prison clothes, and Jehoiachin ate regularly at the king's table for the rest of his life,",
