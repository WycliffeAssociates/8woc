  "3": "It happened on the next day that Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, \"Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but you are Magor Missabib.",
  "4": "For Yahweh says this, 'Look, I will make you an object of horror, you and all of your loved ones, for they will fall by the sword of their enemies and your eyes will see it. I will give all of Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He will make them captives in Babylon or attack them with the sword.",
  "5": "I will give him all the wealth of this city and all of its riches, all of its precious items and all the treasures of the kings of Judah. I will place these things in the hand of your enemies, and they will seize them. They will take them and bring them to Babylon.",
  "6": "But you, Pashhur, and all the inhabitants of your house will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon and die there. You and all of your loved ones to whom you prophesied\ndeceitful things will be buried there.'\"",
  "7": "\"You deceived me, Yahweh. I was indeed deceived. You seized me and defeated me.\n\\q I have become a laughingstock. The people mock me every day, all the day.\n\\q",

  "9": "If I say, 'I will not think about Yahweh anymore. I will no longer proclaim his name.'\n\\q Then it is like a fire in my heart, held within my bones. So I struggle to contain it but I cannot.",
  "10": "I have heard rumors of terror from many people all around. 'Report! We must report it!'\n\\q Those who are close to me watch to see if I will fall. 'Perhaps he can be tricked.\n\\q If so, we can overpower him and take our revenge on him.'\n\\q",

  "15": "Let the man who informed my father be cursed,\n\\q the one who said, 'A male child has been born to you,' causing great joy.",
  "16": "Let that man be like the cities that Yahweh overthrew when he would not have mercy.\n\\q May he hear a call for help in the dawn and the shout of battle at noontime.\n\\q",
  "17": "May this happen, since Yahweh did not kill me in the womb or make my mother my tomb,\n\\q a pregnant womb forever.\n\\q",
