  "2": "Even if they are saying, 'By the life of Yahweh,' they are making false oaths.\"\n\\q",
  "3": "Yahweh, do your eyes not look for faithfulness? You struck the people, but they do not feel pain.\n\\q You have completely defeated them, but they still refuse to receive discipline. They make their faces harder than rock, for they refuse to repent.",
  "4": "So I said, \"Surely these are only poor people.\n\\q They are foolish, for they do not know Yahweh's ways, nor their God's decrees.\n\\q",
  "5": "I will go to the important people and declare God's messages to them, for they at least know Yahweh's ways,\n\\q the decrees of their God. But they all broke their yoke together; they all tore apart the chains that bound them to God.\n\\q",

  "15": "See! I am about to bring a nation against you from far away, house of Israel—this is Yahweh's declaration—\n\\q it is a lasting nation, an ancient nation! It is a nation whose language you do not know,\n\\q nor will you understand what they say.",
