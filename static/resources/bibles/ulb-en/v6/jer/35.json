  "4": "I took them to the house of Yahweh, into the rooms of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God. These rooms were beside the room of the leaders, which was above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the gatekeeper.",
  "5": "Then I placed bowls and cups full of wine in front of the Rechabites and said to them, \"Drink some wine.\"",
  "6": "But they said, \"We will not drink any wine, for our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab, commanded us, 'Do not drink any wine, neither you nor your descendants, forever.",

  "15": "I sent out to you all my servants, the prophets. I was persistent in sending them to say, 'Let each person turn from his wicked way and do good deeds; let no one walk any longer after other gods and worship them.
