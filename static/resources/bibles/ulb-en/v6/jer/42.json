  "3": "Ask Yahweh your God to tell us the way we should go and what we should do.\"",
  "4": "So Jeremiah the prophet said to them, \"I have heard you. Look, I will pray to Yahweh your God as you have requested. Whatever Yahweh answers, I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you.\"",
  "5": "They said to Jeremiah, \"May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not do everything that Yahweh your God tells us to do.",
