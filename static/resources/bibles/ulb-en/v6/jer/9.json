  "3": "Yahweh declares, \"They tread on their bows of lies with their tongues,\n\\q but it is not because of any faithfulness of theirs that they grow strong on the earth.\n\\q They go from wicked act to another. They do not know me.\"",
  "4": "Each of you, be on guard against your neighbor and do not trust in any brother.\n\\q For every brother is certainly a deceiver, and every neighbor walks in slander.\n\\q",
  "5": "Each man mocks his neighbor and does not speak the truth.\n\\q Their tongues teach deceitful things. They are exhausted from committing iniquity.\n\\q",
  "6": "Your dwelling is in the midst of deception; in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me. This is Yahweh's declaration.\"",
  "7": "So Yahweh of hosts says this, \"See, I am about to test them. I will examine them.\n\\q How else should I act for the daughter of my people?\n\\q",

  "14": "It is because they have walked by their stubborn hearts and have followed the Baals as their fathers taught them to do.",
  "15": "Therefore Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, says this, 'See, I am about to make this people eat wormwood and drink poisonous water.",
