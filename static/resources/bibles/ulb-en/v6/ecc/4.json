  "2": "So I congratulate dead people, those who have already died,\n\\q2 not the living, those who are still alive.\n\\q1",
  "3": "However, more fortunate than both of them is the one who has not yet lived,\n\\q2 the one who has not seen any of the evil acts that are done under the sun.",
  "4": "Then I saw that every act of labor and every skillful work became the envy of one's neighbor. This also is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.",
