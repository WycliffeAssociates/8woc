  "2": "Do not be too quick to speak with your mouth,\n\\q2 and do not let your heart be too quick to bring any matter up before God.\n\\q1 God is in heaven, but you are on earth,\n\\q2 so let your words be few.\n\\q1",
  "3": "If you have too many things to do and worry about, you will probably have bad dreams.\n\\q2 The more words you speak, the more foolish things you will probably say .",

  "5": "It is better not to make a vow than to make one that you do not carry out.",
  "6": "Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin. Do not say to the priest's messenger, \"That vow was a mistake.\" Why make God angry by vowing falsely, provoking God to destroy the work of your hands?",
