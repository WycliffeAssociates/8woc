  "3": "Then Moses said to Aaron, \"This is what Yahweh was talking about when he said,\n\\q 'I will reveal my holiness to those who come near me.\n\\q I will be glorified before all the people.'\"\n\\m\nAaron did not say anything.",
  "4": "Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, \"Come here and carry your brothers out of the camp from before the tabernacle.\"",
  "5": "So they came near and carried them, still wearing their priestly tunics, out of the camp, as Moses had instructed.",
  "6": "Then Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, \"Do not let your hair on your heads hang loosely, and do not tear your clothes, so that you may not die, and so that Yahweh may not be angry with all the assembly. But allow your relatives, the entire house of Israel, to mourn for those whom the fire of Yahweh has set ablaze.",
  "7": "You must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will die, for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you.\" So they acted according to Moses' instructions.",
  "8": "Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,",
  "9": "\"Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, or your sons who remain with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, so you will not die. This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations,",

  "14": "The breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented to Yahweh, you must eat in a clean place acceptable to God.

  "17": "\"Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the area of the tabernacle, since it is most holy, and since Yahweh has given it to you to take away the iniquity of the assembly, to make atonement for them before him?",
  "18": "Look, its blood was not brought inside the tabernacle, so you should certainly have eaten it in the tabernacle area, as I commanded.\"",
  "19": "Then Aaron answered Moses, \"See, today they made their sin offering and burnt offering before Yahweh, and this thing has happened to me today. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?\"",
  "20": "When Moses heard that, he was satisfied."
