  "41": "He will require all the inside walls of the house to be scraped, and they must take the contaminated material that is scraped off outside the city and dump it into the unclean place.",
  "42": "They must take other stones and put them in the place of the stones that were removed, and they must use new clay to plaster the house.",
  "43": "If mildew comes again and breaks out in the house in which the stones have been taken away and the walls have been scraped and then replastered,",
  "44": "then the priest must come in and examine the house to see if mildew has spread in the house. If it has, then it is harmful mildew, and the house is unclean.",
  "45": "The house must be torn down. The stones, timber, and all the plaster in the house must be carried away out of the city to the unclean place.",
  "46": "In addition, whoever goes into the house during the time it is closed up will be unclean until evening.",
