  "1": "When all the work that Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was completed, Solomon brought in the things that David, his father, had set apart for this purpose, including the silver, the gold, and all the furnishingsâ€”he placed them into the treasuries of the house of God.",
  "2": "Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the families of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, that is, Zion.",

  "4": "All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.",
  "5": "They brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy furnishing that were in the tent. The priests who were of the tribe of Levi brought these things up.",

  "7": "The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the inner room of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.",
  "8": "For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and they covered the ark and the poles by which it was carried.",
  "9": "The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner room, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.",

  "13": "It came about that the trumpeters and singers made music together, making one sound to be heard for praising and thanking Yahweh. They raised their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and other instruments, and they praised Yahweh. They sang, \"For he is good, for his covenant loyalty endures forever.\" Then the house, the house of Yahweh, was filled with a cloud.",
  "14": "The priests could not stand in order to serve because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled his house."
