  "1": "After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came and entered Judah. He camped to attack the fortified cities, which he intended to capture for himself.",
  "2": "When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to fight against Jerusalem,",
  "3": "he consulted with his leaders and his powerful men to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city; they helped him do so.",
  "4": "So many people gathered together and stopped up all the springs and the stream that was flowing through the middle of the land. They said, \"Why should the kings of Assyria come and find a lot of water?\"",
  "5": "Hezekiah took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down. He built the towers higher, and also the other wall outside.

  "9": "After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (now he was in front of Lachish, and all his army was with him), to Hezekiah, king of Judah, and to all of Judah who were in Jerusalem. He said,",

  "14": "Among all the gods of those nations that my ancestors completely destroyed, was there any god who could rescue his people out of my hand? Why should your God be able to rescue you from my power?",
  "15": "Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you in this way. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people out of my hand, or out of the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God rescue you from my hand?\"",

  "25": "But Hezekiah did not pay back Yahweh for the help given to him, for his heart was lifted up. So anger came on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.",
