  "4": "Now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean.",
  "5": "Look, you will become pregnant and give birth to a son. No razor will be used upon his head, for the child will be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.\"",
  "6": "Then the woman came and told her husband, \"A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, very terrible. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.",
  "7": "He said to me, 'Look! You will become pregnant, and you will give birth to a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and do not eat any food that the law declares to be unclean, because the child will be a Nazirite to God from the time he is in your womb until the day of his death.'\"",
  "8": "Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh and said, \"Oh, Lord, please let the man of God you sent come again to us so that he may teach us what we are to do for the child who soon will be born.\"",

  "11": "Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, \"Are you the man who spoke with my wife?\" The man said, \"I am.\"",
  "12": "So Manoah said, \"Now may your words come true. What will be the rules for the child, and what will be his work?\"",
  "13": "The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, \"She must carefully do everything that I said to her.",
  "14": "She may not eat anything that comes from the vines, and do not let her drink wine or strong drink; do not let her eat any food that the law declares to be unclean. She should obey everything I commanded her to do.\"",
  "15": "Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, \"Please stay for a while, to give us time to prepare a young goat for you.\"",
  "16": "The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, \"Even if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to Yahweh.\" (Manoah did not know that he was the angel of Yahweh.)",
  "17": "Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, \"What is your name, so we may honor you when your words come true?\"",
