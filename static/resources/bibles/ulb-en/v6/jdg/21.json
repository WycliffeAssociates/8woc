  "3": "They called out, \"Why, Yahweh, God of Israel, has this happened to Israel, that one of our tribes should be missing today?\"",
  "4": "The next day the people got up early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.",
  "5": "The people of Israel said, \"Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to Yahweh?\" For they had made an important promise concerning anyone who did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah. They said, \"He would certainly be put to death.\"",
  "6": "The people of Israel had compassion for their brother Benjamin. They said, \"Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel.",
  "7": "Who will provide wives for those who are left, since we have made a promise to Yahweh that we will not let any of them marry our daughters?\"",
  "8": "They said, \"Which of the tribes of Israel did not come up to Yahweh at Mizpah?\" It was found that no one had come to the assembly from Jabesh Gilead.",
  "9": "For when the people were set out in an orderly manner, behold, none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead were there.",
  "10": "The assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and attack them, and kill them, even the women and children.",

  "15": "The people were sorry for what happened to Benjamin, because Yahweh made a division between the tribes of Israel.",

  "17": "They said, \"There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe is not destroyed from Israel.",
  "18": "We cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the people of Israel had made a promise, 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin.'\"",
  "19": "So they said, \"You know there is a feast for Yahweh every year at Shiloh (which is north of Bethel, east of the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah).\"",
  "20": "They instructed the men of Benjamin, saying, \"Go and hide in secret and wait in the vineyards.",
  "21": "Watch for the time when the girls from Shiloh come out to dance, then rush out of the vineyards and each one of you should grab a wife from the girls of Shiloh, then go back to the land of Benjamin.",
