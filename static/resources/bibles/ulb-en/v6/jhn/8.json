  "43": "Why do you not understand my words? It is because you cannot hear my words.",
  "44": "You are of your father, the devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies.",
