  "5": "\"Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?\"",

  "10": "The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;",
  "11": "for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.",
  "12": "On the next day a great crowd came to the festival. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,",
  "13": "they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.\"",
  "14": "Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it was written,",
  "15": "\"Do not fear, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey.\"",

  "17": "Now the crowd testified that they had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead ones.",
  "18": "It was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.",
  "19": "The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, \"Look, you can do nothing; see, the world has gone after him.\"",
  "20": "Now certain Greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the festival.",
  "21": "These went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, \"Sir, we want to see Jesus.\"",
  "22": "Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip, and they told Jesus.",

  "32": "When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself.\"",
  "33": "He said this to indicate what kind of death he would die.",
  "34": "The crowd answered him, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ will stay forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?\"",
  "35": "Jesus then said to them, \"The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.",

  "37": "Although Jesus had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him",
  "38": "so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled, in which he said:\n\\q \"Lord, who has believed our report,\n\\q and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\"\n\\m",

  "40": "\"He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts;\n\\q otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand with their hearts,\n\\q and turn,\n\\q and I would heal them.\"\n\\m",
  "41": "Isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of Jesus and spoke of him.",

  "48": "The one who rejects me and who does not receive my words, has one who judges him. The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day.",
