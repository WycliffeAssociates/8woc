  "3": "Jesus replied to him, \"Truly, truly, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"",
  "4": "Nicodemus said to him, \"How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?\"",
  "5": "Jesus replied, \"Truly, truly, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.",
  "6": "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.",

  "20": "For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light so that his deeds will not be exposed.",
  "21": "However, he who practices the truth comes to the light so that it may be plainly seen that his deeds have been done in God.\"",
