  "21": "so that they will all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I am in you. I pray that they will also be in us so that the world will believe that you have sent me.",

  "26": "I made your name known to them, and I will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me will be in them, and I will be in them.\""
