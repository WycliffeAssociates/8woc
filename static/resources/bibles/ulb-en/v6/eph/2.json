  "3": "We all were once among these unbelievers. We were acting according to the evil desires of our flesh. We were doing the will of the flesh and of the mind. We were by nature children of wrath like the others.",

  "15": "That is, he abolished the law of commandments and regulations so that he might create one new man in himself. He made peace.",
  "16": "He did this to reconcile both peoples into one body to God through the cross. With the cross he put to death the hostility.",

  "21": "In him the whole building fits together and grows as a temple in the Lord.",
  "22": "It is in him that you also are being built together as a dwelling place for God in the Spirit."
