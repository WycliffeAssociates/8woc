  "5": "By the promises contained in the covenant that I established with you when you came out of Egypt\n\\q and my Spirit standing among you, do not fear!",
  "6": "For Yahweh of hosts says this: In a little while\n\\q I will once again shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land!\n\\q",
  "7": "I will shake every nation, and every nation will bring their precious things to me,\n\\q and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of hosts.",

  "17": "I afflicted you and all the work of your hands with blight and mildew, but you still did not turn to me—this is Yahweh's declaration.",
  "18": "Consider from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of Yahweh's temple was laid. Consider it!",
