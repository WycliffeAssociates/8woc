  "14": "For you must worship no other god, for I, Yahweh, whose name is 'Jealous,' am a jealous God.",
  "15": "So be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for they prostitute themselves to their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods. Then one of them will invite you and you will eat some of his sacrifice,",
