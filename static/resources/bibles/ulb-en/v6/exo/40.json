  "20": "He took the covenant decrees and put them into the ark. He also placed the poles on the ark and put the atonement lid on it.",
  "21": "He brought the ark into the tabernacle. He set up the curtain for it to shield the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh had commanded him.",
  "22": "He put the table into the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain.",

  "27": "He burned fragrant incense on it, as Yahweh had commanded him.",
  "28": "He hung the curtain at the tabernacle entrance.",
  "29": "He put the altar for the burnt offering at the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting. He offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as Yahweh had commanded him.",

  "31": "Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet from the basin",
  "32": "whenever they would go into the tent of meeting and whenever they would go up to the altar. They washed themselves, as Yahweh had commanded Moses.",
  "33": "Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar. He set up the curtain at the courtyard entrance. In this way, Moses finished the work.",
  "34": "Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle.",
  "35": "Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and because Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle.",
  "36": "Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out on their journey.",
  "37": "But if the cloud did not rise up from the tabernacle, then the people would not travel. They would stay until the day that it was lifted up.",
  "38": "For Yahweh's cloud was over the tabernacle by day, and his fire was over it by night, in plain view of all the people of Israel throughout their journey."
