  "4": "So about eating food sacrificed to idols—we know that \"an idol in this world is nothing\" and \"that there is no God but one.\"",
  "5": "For maybe so-called gods do exist, either in heaven or on earth, just as there are many \"gods\" and many \"lords.\"",

  "12": "Thus, when you sin against your brothers and wound their weak consciences, you sin against Christ.",
