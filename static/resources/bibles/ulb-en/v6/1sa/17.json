  "39": "David strapped his sword on his armor. But he was not able to walk, because he had not trained with them. Then David said to Saul, \"I cannot go out to fight with these, for I have not trained with them.\" So David put them off.",

  "47": "and that all this gathering may know that Yahweh does not give victory with sword or spear. For the battle is Yahweh's, and he will give you into our hand.\"",
  "48": "When the Philistine rose and approached David, then David ran quickly toward the enemy army to meet him.",
