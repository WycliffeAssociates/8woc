  "4": "The Gibeonites responded to him, \"It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his family. In the same way it is not for us to put to death any man in Israel.\" David replied, \"What are you saying that I should do for you?\"",

  "10": "Then Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the mountain beside the dead bodies, from the beginning of harvest until the rain poured down on them from the sky.

  "11": "It was told to David what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, the slave wife of Saul, had done.",
