  "1": "Now the point of what we are saying is this: We have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.",
  "2": "He is a servant in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up.",
  "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary to have something to offer.",

  "11": "They will not teach each one his neighbor\n\\q and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.'\n\\q For all will know me,\n\\q from the least to the greatest of them.\n\\q",
  "12": "For I will be merciful to their acts of unrighteousness,\n\\q and I will not remember their sins any longer.\"",
  "13": "By saying \"new,\" he has made the first covenant old, and what has become outdated and old is near to disappearing."
