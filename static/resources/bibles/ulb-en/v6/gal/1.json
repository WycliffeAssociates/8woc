  "1": "Paul, an apostle—not an apostle from men nor through human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead ones—",
  "2": "and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:",
  "3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,",
  "4": "who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,",
  "5": "to him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.",
  "6": "I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly from him who called you by the grace of Christ. I am amazed that you are turning to a different gospel.",
  "7": "This is not to say that there is another gospel, but there are some men who cause you trouble and want to change the gospel of Christ.",
  "8": "But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let him be cursed.",
  "9": "As we have said before, so now I say again, \"If someone proclaims to you a gospel other than the one you received, let him be cursed.\"",
  "10": "For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men? If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ.",
  "11": "For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I proclaimed is not man's gospel.",
  "12": "I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it. Instead, it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me.",
  "13": "You have heard about my former life in Judaism, how I was persecuting the church of God beyond measure and that I was trying to destroy it.",
  "14": "I advanced in Judaism beyond many of those who were my own age, from out of my own people. That is how extremely zealous I was for the traditions of my fathers.",
  "15": "But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb, and who called me through his grace,",
  "16": "was pleased to reveal his Son in me, so that I would proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood.",
  "17": "I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who had become apostles before me. Instead, I went to Arabia and then returned to Damascus.",
  "18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Cephas and I stayed with him fifteen days.",
  "19": "But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.",
  "20": "In what I write to you, I assure you before God, that I am not lying.",
  "21": "Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
  "22": "I was still not personally known to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.",
  "23": "They only heard it being said, \"The man who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy.\"",
  "24": "So they glorified God because of me."
